<article class="post-content">
  
<p>Around 18 months ago or so, the following thought occurred to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mind is constantly complaining, claiming that there’s never a quiet moment around here, that there always seem to be surrounding noise  appearing, in some form or another, disturbing the conditions for practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometime later, however, when the surroundings actually got quiet and the <em>external</em> conditions became superb for practice — including the weather conditions, such as wind and temperature — I noticed that the mind itself was not quiet <em>internally</em>.</p>

<p>Observing this, I realized that my mind was indeed a hypocrite: It was complaining about external noise, demanding a quiet environment to practice in, yet at times when surrounding conditions in fact were noiseless, it would nonetheless continue to engage in its own internal chatter, thus <em>itself</em> disturb the conditions for practice. Isn’t that a typical symptom of hypocritical behavior? Traits of a hypocrite? I readily decided to treat it as such — because I knew this was a problem.</p>

<p>A problem, how so? These complaints were founded on the <em>idea</em> of an ideal environment with overall surrounding conditions very suitable for practice. Now, if external sounds’ characteristics were not in compliance with the requirements set by this ideal — for example, sounds from hammering, a drill, a squeaky car — then they were instantly classified as noise. And since noise is unpleasant and disturbing, aversion arose in the mind whenever it made contact with what was perceived as noise. In response to the aversion, the mind reacted in a complaining manner. This was how the hypocritical complaints originated. Furthermore, with aversion as a preexisting condition, each subsequent complaint would sustain the aversion, nourish it, and tighten its grasp on the mind, and therefore increase the tendency for further complaints to arise in the future. There the problem: a vicious cycle, very detrimental to the practice.</p>

<p>The sequence above starts with my overall willingness to practice but ends with the conditions for practice becoming worse. This was the influence of the defilements that cluttered my mind. They knew very well that they would be done away with if they were to allow the practice to continue. So naturally, they tried to prevent that from happening. In this case by making use of my willingness to practice to in fact worsen the conditions for practice. Very clever.</p>

<p>In general, the Dhamma within my mind is inclined to undertake the practice, which is good; but then the defilements, also roaming within the mind, have to rise up and resist in order to protect their longevity — doing so with whatever insidious trickery they can come up with. It was this conflict between the Dhamma and the defilements that brought about the hypocritical behavior mentioned above.</p>

<h2 id="a-method">A Method</h2>

<p>In response to this realization, I determined that whenever my mind would complain and sustain aversion in this manner again, I would remind myself of its previous pattern of inconsistent behavior, and then confront it in such a way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enough with this aversion! Stop complaining about the surrounding sounds that happen to disturb you. Let me remind you that when surroundings eventually turn quiet, as you now demand, you won’t be quiet yourself; you won’t take advantage of the opportunity. I’ve seen it. It’s a fact. Therefore you have no say — no right to complain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any argument of this sort, constructed with the aim to reveal the mind’s ongoing hypocrisy for it to clearly see, I reasoned, would release it from its delusion, and consequently incline me to</p>

<ul>
  <li>stop all complaints and other harmful, aversive thoughts (internal sounds) immediately;</li>
  <li>take advantage of the moment as an opportunity to step back and observe the aversion — its characteristics of impermanence, harmfulness and not-self — to gain insights and find motivation to practice; and</li>
  <li>reduce the potential for this problem of complaints about noise — about external sounds that are out of my control — to arise again in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all favorable outcomes. But why did I assume that an argument like the above would serve as a countermeasure and actually result in these outcomes? Why wouldn’t the mind carry on with its ways as if totally unaffected? It would — if it weren’t for the qualities of honesty and integrity. Without honesty, the mind would never admit that it’s behaving hypocritically; without integrity, the mind wouldn’t have a problem with such inconsistent behavior to begin with. And because they challenge the defilements, both honesty and integrity count as part of the Dhamma within the mind. I was confident I had acquired enough of these good qualities in this regard.</p>

<p>In short, this anti-hypocrite method consisted of two parts: firstly, to confront the mind with an argument that revealed its ongoing hypocritical behavior (a pattern already established); secondly, to rely on honesty and integrity (qualities already attained) to prevail and yield the above outcomes.</p>

<p>Armed with this method, I began using it to address the complaining/aversion problem. And as planned, whenever the hypocrite appeared in response to external noise, it vanished as soon as it was revealed.</p>

<p>But not long after, at a moment free from external sounds, I observed the same hypocrite lurking around again: the mind absorbed and engaged in its own internal sounds, chattering along, self-entertained, and oblivious to (or possibly aware, but dismissive of) the — now ideal — surroundings. Perhaps my anti-hypocrite method wasn’t wholly anti-hypocrite after all?</p>

<p>The initial reveal of the hypocrite was deduced from the mind’s inconsistent behavior in two <em>situations</em>: the ideal situation just mentioned, where external conditions were satisfied; and the situation where they were not. I only considered the latter as I devised my method, because only non-ideal situations gave rise to the problem I was focused on — the problem of complaints and aversion. But after having recognized the hypocrite again, now during an ideal situation, I recalled that there was indeed a problem connected with ideal situations as well.</p>

<p>In terms of this second problem, the external conditions were already ideal so there was nothing to complain or be aversive about. Instead, the mind was oblivious to the favorable surroundings, or choosing to disregard them, or both. More deluded, you could say, than aversive. As a result, the mind became ungrateful, wasteful of time and energy, and reluctant to take advantage of the ideal situation. Essentially, the second problem was heedlessness.</p>

<p>As for my method, even though it did solve the first problem, it was not designed specifically to target that problem — or any problem at all. It was directed solely at the mind’s hypocritical behavior and downfall, and therefore effective against <em>whatever problem</em> that would dissipate as a result. And because the <em>same</em> hypocritical behavior was accompanying <em>both</em> problems — was deduced from <em>both</em> situations — the method was effective against both problems — in both situations.</p>

<p>The arguments, however, needed to be specific to the problem at hand. Therefore, to address the second problem, I adjusted the arguments to point to heedlessness instead (as opposed to complaints and aversion). But I still had to make sure, following the method, to reveal the hypocritical behavior:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t you realize that it’s quiet now? If you could be quiet for just one moment and pay attention …. Why don’t you appreciate and take advantage of this opportunity now that the external sounds finally have disappeared? Or would you rather continue to engage in idle chatter that lead nowhere but to harm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>See, now it is quiet. This is what you wanted, wasn’t it? Didn’t you complain about this and that noise before? Then you better appreciate this opportunity and take advantage of it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the second problem settled — the defilements having lost their control — I was free to</p>

<ul>
  <li>acknowledge that the external conditions had changed and were now satisfactory;</li>
  <li>begin to appreciate the moment;</li>
  <li>take advantage of the moment (by applying a suitable aspect of the training); and</li>
  <li>reduce the potential for this problem of heedlessness in the absence of external noise to arise again in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>These outcomes of solving the second problem are notably similar to the outcomes of solving the first problem: they make way for and promote practice, they also make it clear what beneficial actions are obstructed by the hypocritical behavior. The similarities between both sets of outcomes further show that the method indeed was effective against both problems, that it therefore could handle both sides of the hypocrite, and that it therefore was useful in both ideal and non-ideal situations.</p>

<h2 id="still-in-use-today">Still in Use Today</h2>

<p>Because the method proved successful from the beginning and because the two problems have continued to arise, I have found no reason yet to stop using the method as it still benefits me to this day.</p>

<p>In fact, at the time of writing this, it’s often a much quicker process. In such cases — if, for example, I notice the mind aversive and complaining in reference to external noise — it’s enough to raise a short and simple argument in the form of a question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it were quiet now, would the mind be quiet too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of having adopted the method now for the last 18 months (or so), the underlying defilements have weakened and can therefore be defeated more easily and quite automatically in a matter of a few seconds, simply by posing a short question like that.</p>

<p>Here’s another example of a present-day argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interesting. Aversion arose right now in response to that sudden sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compared to the arguments constructed in the early stages of adopting the method, today’s arguments may seem inadequate with respect to the method’s requirements because they do not clearly identify and reveal the hypocritical behavior. While that may have been true 18 months ago, I am much more familiar with this particular hypocrite today — to the degree that these sorts of arguments, which merely nudge at either side of the mind’s inconsistent behavior, will suffice to recollect the whole concept of the hypocrite, and consequently reveal it.</p>

<p>That explains why the process is quicker now: the arguments are allowed be shorter and less explicit while still conforming to the method. The actual construction of the arguments requires less effort too, making the process less energy-consuming. The given examples also show that the arguments have become less harsh; having gained broader and deeper knowledge of the hypocritical behavior and its detrimental effects, that harsh attitude — often included to enhance the arguments’ impact on the mind as a wake-up call — has naturally softened.</p>

<p>Having said that, my mind is of course still not fully trained. And the untrained mind is still the ignorant mind, constantly changing as it’s reacting to feeling born of contact.<sup id="fnref:dependent-arising"><a href="#fn:dependent-arising" class="footnote">1</a></sup> As a result of its conditions changing in this way, my mind might very well become unstable/unsettled/uncertain to the degree that I’ll have to revert to explicit, full-length and possibly harsh arguments again in order to break through and reveal the hypocrite.</p>

<p>So even though the process in general is quicker and more automatic today, it’s not always the case. Sure, there are aspects of mindfulness and discernment (those relating to the noise-hypocritical behavior) that have gained in strength, but I cannot sit back and rely on them to automatically resolve these matters on their own. Whatever the current state of mind, I have to take measures accordingly when constructing the arguments, making them explicit and verbose to the extent necessary for the method to be effective.</p>

<h2 id="formulation">Formulation</h2>

<p>Theoretically, the method is simple — it can be formulated as a sequence of three steps.</p>

<p>To start, there are two <em>sides</em> of inconsistent behavior that constitute the mind’s hypocritical behavior:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one side (<em>A</em>) that is a reaction to <em>non-ideal</em> conditions, i.e. the mind complaining about external noise; and</li>
  <li>one side (<em>B</em>) that manifests during <em>ideal</em> conditions, i.e. when the mind, even though in the absence of external noise, itself isn’t quiet.</li>
</ul>

<p>What counts as “ideal”, of course, depends entirely on the mind’s current biases, lead by the defilements.</p>

<p>As each side manifests, two particular <em>problems</em> arise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[for side <em>A</em>] the problem of complaints (call it <em>PA</em>)</li>
  <li>[for side <em>B</em>] the problem of heedlessness (call it <em>PB</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The method is effective against both problems and therefore applicable in two typical <em>situations</em>, each characterized by an active side together with its respective problem (<em>A</em> + <em>PA</em> and <em>B</em> + <em>PB</em>).</p>

<p>In the non-ideal situation (when side <em>A</em> is active) the method prescribes the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the <em>complaining</em> mind as a result of external <em>non-ideal</em> conditions (A + <em>PA</em>).</li>
  <li>Construct an argument against this side of the hypocrite (<em>A</em>) that reveals it by referring to its other side (<em>B</em>).</li>
  <li>Reap the results and take further actions to advance practice.</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly in the other situation (but now <em>B</em> is active so it switches with <em>A</em>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the <em>heedless</em> mind as a result of external <em>ideal</em> conditions (B + <em>PB</em>).</li>
  <li>Construct an argument against this side of the hypocrite (<em>B</em>) that reveals it by referring to its other side (<em>A</em>).</li>
  <li>Reap the results and take further actions to advance practice.</li>
</ol>

<p>The trick that outwits the defilements happens during step 2, when the hypocritical behavior is revealed by referring to its inactive side. That’s the crucial part. If omitted, the inactive side would be kept obscured by the active side and no hypocrite would be revealed. So, in both situations, the method takes advantage of the inactive sides to accomplish its purpose — regardless of whether the targeted problem is the complaining mind, or the heedless mind. Prior knowledge of both sides is therefore a necessary precondition.</p>

<p>In step 3 the results are provided by good qualities previously attained from development on the path, honesty and integrity in particular. It’s also suggested to not be content with these results and instead aim to develop further.</p>

<h2 id="extends-to-time-and-place">Extends to Time and Place</h2>

<p>Now that I’ve become more familiar with this behavioral pattern, I’ve begun to recognize its traits in situations other than those relating to sound. In fact, I’ve realized that the same pattern extends to <em>time</em> and <em>place</em> as well. In other words, not only does the mind behave hypocritically as described — complaining in non-ideal situations and heedless in ideal situations — when in contact with the external sense object of sound, but additionally, the very same pattern is triggered as the mind comes into contact with certain ideas of time and place. In both cases, I recognize the pattern in the non-ideal situation, as I become aware of the problem of complaints.</p>

<p>In the case of time, the non-ideal is lack thereof: when there are chores awaiting or I have to attend to worldly matters, the mind complains and claims that there’s not enough time available for practice. It might even stir up a slight sense of panic by strongly suggesting that I cannot go on under these circumstances, that I need to make changes in order to free up more time. That’s not true though. There’s plenty of time available that I’m not, or at least not wholeheartedly, taking advantage of (e.g. chores can be excellent practice opportunities). What happens is, of course, that when time <em>is</em> available, the mind doesn’t take advantage of it, doesn’t appreciate it, disregards it, doesn’t acknowledge it — is heedless.</p>

<p>Not until I begin to fully take advantage of every opportunity I have to practice, every window of available time each day — waking up, going to sleep, eating, relieving myself of that which I ate, moving from here to there, etc. — only then can I regard these complaints as valid; only then, should I decide whether structural changes are appropriate. But for now, I say this is clearly in line with the previous pattern of hypocritical behavior.</p>

<p>Before I can describe how the pattern extends to place, I first need to clarify what I mean by “a place”. A place — is a specific area, that’s nearby, that’s accessible, and that can be both non-ideal and ideal depending on its surroundings. A place could be a path for walking meditation, a garden spot, under a tree; or a larger area such as a city quarter, a forest region; or indoors, for example a designated meditation room.</p>

<p>Whether a place is ideal or not depends on the mind’s biases in relation to surrounding sights, sounds<sup id="fnref:sound-place"><a href="#fn:sound-place" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, smells, and tactile sensations; and on the position of forms, such as a person, animal or inanimate object; and on social aspects as well. For example, if it’s raining, a walking path isn’t ideal. But if the rain stops, it becomes ideal. Then say a cow positions itself on the path, blocking the way — again, not ideal. And if other people are affected negatively as they see me doing walking meditation on the path — or if I am, as I become aware of them — then that would make it a non-ideal place too.</p>

<p>So naturally, the mind complains that there aren’t any places around where I can practice; and it might also claim that I first need to make necessary arrangements to relocate to wherever there are ideal places readily available to me, and then — <em>then</em> I’ll be able to practice. And of course, when these places’ surroundings change in such a way that they become ideal, the mind doesn’t take advantage of them, doesn’t appreciate them, disregards them, doesn’t acknowledge them — is heedless. That’s how the pattern extends to place.</p>

<p>Because the method was devised based on this pattern it’s effective in these cases relating to time and place as well, because all ingredients of the method’s formula are still present, so nothing’s really changed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there are still the two sides of the same hypocritical behavior;</li>
  <li>there are still the same two problems;</li>
  <li>there’s still a non-ideal situation, and consequently, an ideal one; and</li>
  <li>because honesty and integrity are internal qualities, they remain unaffected.</li>
</ul>

<p>So all three steps in the method’s formulation are still feasible, which leaves four ways to carry out the steps as the pattern extends to time and place:</p>

<p>In reference to time, non-ideal situation: The mind complains about there being no time to practice (step 1). I argue that there are many periods of available time when the opportunity to practice is not taken advantage of (step 2). The complaints stop (step 3).</p>

<p>In reference to time, ideal situation: There <em>is</em> time available, but the mind is not taking advantage of the opportunity to practice, heedless (1). I remind the mind that it usually complains about there being no time to practice, and that now there actually is (2). The heedlessness stops (3).</p>

<p>In reference to place, non-ideal situation: The mind complains about there being no good places around to practice (1). I argue that on occasions when there are, the mind is not practicing, heedless (2). The complaints stop (3).</p>

<p>In reference to place, ideal situation: There are these good places to practice, but the mind is not practicing, heedless (1). I remind the mind that it usually complains about there being no good places around to practice, and that now there actually are (2). The heedlessness stops (3).</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>When I initially used the method only to deal with the pattern relating to sound, I could not have conceived of using the method in cases relating to time and place as well. It makes me wonder to what further extent the method is effective.</p>

<p>Time and place are very general areas, and there are therefore a large number of scenarios involving them where the method is useful. They are mental ideas, which means that they are one of the six external sense media. Sound, which is more blatant, is part of the other five. Following this line of thought, it’s not far-fetched that the method is effective in situations relating to the remaining four as well; that is, sights, smells, tastes and tactile sensations. If there are disturbing smells, for instance, the problem of complaints might arise. And at a later time, when there aren’t any smells that disturbs the mind anymore, the problem of heedlessness might arise as the mind acts hypocritically in the same way as it did in relation to noise. So, in addition to time and place, the method is useful in situations relating to all sensory contact, not just sound.</p>

<p>But there’s yet another unexpected territory where I’ve recognized the hypocritical behavior and where the method has proven effective: I occasionally find myself wondering about other people’s views, how they can live their lives as they do, without Right View, without trying to deal with the dangers of aging, illness and death, which are undoubtedly coming their way. How are they content with burying this fact within themselves? And seconds later it strikes me — I am focusing on other people when I could attend to my own practice. I am no different, engaging in wrong views too — heedless.</p>

<p>This case is interesting because even though the problem of heedlessness clearly exists, the problem of complaints is not really apparent. I am not complaining, nor am I aversive as these thoughts occur to me. Yet the hypocritical behavior is present, so — according to the method’s formulation — the problem of complains must exist as well. If that’s the case, where are the complaints?</p>

<p>One possibility is that the mind complains about other people’s wrong views; that, ideally, everyone should have Right View. But if this is the case, I am certainly not aware of it, and I find it extremely unlikely. I cannot imagine that this is true, that I’m so unreasonable and naive that I blame others as an excuse not to practice.</p>

<p>But if the problem here isn’t the usual problem of complaints, what exactly is it? In this case, the complaints have shifted into bewilderment and confusion. Instead of complaining about noise, for example, I am unable to understand other people’s mindset.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, the method is still effective here — even though the problem of complaints is absent — because as soon as I recognize the hypocritical behavior, it’s immediately abandoned, after which I begin directing concern toward my own views and resolves instead.</p>

<p>The method’s formulation, however, specifically mentions the problem of complaints, which means that the formulation doesn’t encompass all situations for which the method is effective, such as the given example. I have to refine the problem of complaints if I want the method’s formulation to be an accurate criterion for all cases when the method is useful. Its definition needs to be generalized to include both complaints and bewilderment, as well as any other currently unknown characterization of this kind of problem. According to the formulation, the kind of problem I am looking to describe is one that arises as a reaction to the non-ideal situation.</p>

<p>A more accurate description of this problem is: <em>A problem, that arises in the non-ideal situation, which upon recollection in the ideal situation, after the problem of heedlessness has been recognized, reveals the hypocritical behavior.</em></p>

<p>With the problem of complaints refined, I can get a more accurate understanding to which extent the method is useful. The next question I ask myself is if the method can be used as I develop further along the path. Is it a method that is effective all the way to arahantship, to where the path ends? Or is it only appropriate around my current level of development?</p>

<p>To analyze this, I have to look at the formulation of the method again and investigate its prerequisites. As long as its prerequisites can exist, the method should be applicable. The prerequisites are essentially two: the hypocritical behavior; and honesty and integrity. So how far along the path can they be found?</p>

<p>The hypocritical behavior is formed from the two inconsistent sides described in the formulation, which when manifest, gives rise to the two problems. So the possibility for the hypocritical behavior to exist, depends on whether these two problems can arise. Therefore, the next question I have to ask myself is whether these two problems actually can arise during the whole path of development. In terms of the problem of heedlessness, the answer is yes. If one is heedless, one does not practice, and only practice will lead to the end of the path. For this reason, the problem of heedlessness can arise anywhere along the path.<sup id="fnref:noactofwill"><a href="#fn:noactofwill" class="footnote">3</a></sup> As for the other problem — previously referred to as the problem of complaints — its refined definition is now based on the problem of heedlessness, so this problem can arise whenever the problem of heedlessness can. Consequently, since these two problems can arise, so can the hypocritical behavior.</p>

<p>As for honesty and integrity, the second prerequisite, although they are not explicitly part of the Noble Eightfold Path, or any of the seven sets<sup id="fnref:seven-sets"><a href="#fn:seven-sets" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, they are fundamental for the whole practice. If one wants to reach the end of the path, one must observe one’s actions with honesty and integrity.</p>

<p>According to this reasoning, the method’s prerequisites can exist during the whole path of practice (at least while on the mundane level of the path), which means that I should be able to use the method on those occasions.</p>

<p>Although I mentioned in the beginning, that the hypocritical behavior in relation to noise was the result of the conflict between the Dhamma and the defilements within the mind — that’s not always the case. This conflict can certainly occur without it resulting in a hypocritical behavior. So just that fact is not sufficient grounds for applying the method. There has to be the problem of heedlessness on the one hand, and the opposing problem that creates the hypocritical behavior on the other hand.</p>

<p>So even though the above reasoning suggests that the method is applicable during the whole path, it doesn’t mean that it will be effective for every little defilement. In fact, without the hypocritical behavior, the method doesn’t make sense. It can, however, be used from time to time, whenever appropriate, whenever a hypocrite is discerned. But I cannot constantly look for the hypocritical behavior, that will drain my mental energy. Instead, I should train myself to be able to discern it when it’s there, in all its different disguises. Discernment first needs to recognize the hypocritical behavior — then, the method can be used.</p>

<p>At times when I don’t recognize the hypocritical behavior, yet I can sense that my actions are unskillful, there are still plenty of other methods or tricks I could use. The Buddha had lots of methods he taught, the great forest Ajahns had/have several as well, this method is just one of many. Whatever works — whatever I can do to develop further on the path.</p>

<p>I see now, that the hypocritical behavior that I first conceptualized as the mind was complaining about noise, was really just founded on the existence of heedlessness. If I had was nothing to be heedless about, if I didn’t think it was important to stay on, and develop further on the path, the hypocritical behavior would not exist.</p>

      <p>Sound is therefore a subset of a place: it can exist in every place. And it’s the same basic problem whether the mind complains about sound directly or in the context of a place. <a href="#fnref:sound-place" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>There are instances during the practice when there’s no need for an act of will, when the mind will develop by itself. But for those conditions to arise, one cannot be heedless. <a href="#fnref:noactofwill" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
