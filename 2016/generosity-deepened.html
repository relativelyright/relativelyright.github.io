<article class="post-content">
  
<p><em>Three weeks ago:</em></p>

<p>I’ve felt a lot of generosity from a certain family these last few days. They’ve been transporting me back and forth to the hospital, attending to me there, and waiting for me while I was being examined and while I was speaking with the doctor. And last evening they came, unannounced, with a kettle of soup and some bread for me. Given my condition, it was a relief to receive this generosity at this time.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten to know the father from this family during the last three years, having employed him, quite often, for various repair or construction work. But I’ve hardly ever visited his family’s home — only on two or three occasions. I’ve been invited several times, though, but I’ve always declined his offers, mainly because they involved eating in the afternoon or later in the evening. I’ve been training with the precept of not eating after noon for several years and was therefore reluctant to break it. So I’ve had very little contact with the rest of the family — which were the ones who actually took me to the hospital.</p>

<p>So how come they offered to help? Did I ask them? No, I did not. I did call the father, however, to get information regarding available commercial form of transport to the hospital, because he had given me this information once before. But when he found out that I wanted to go to the hospital he immediately offered to help. And he offered in a way that was completely without boundaries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course we will take you. I will help. I’ll ask my family to take you. No problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His response was, of course, a result of my previous good kamma with him. I’ve always treated him with good will, been truthful and sensitive to his well-being. So there was definitely a relationship established with an element of trust and compassion, but not yet at that level that I would consider asking him for this kind of help. His act of generosity therefore was unexpected and made a big impact on me because of the state I was in.</p>

<p>Now, as I’m eating the soup that they gave me, I’m reflecting on that they didn’t have to give me anything — but they did it anyway. I didn’t ask for it. This is how a monk feels everyday; this is the way it is for a monk everyday as he gets his food. If I got all my food in this way everyday, I would be extremely grateful. I am more sensitive and receptive to this generosity now because I’m in that state of combined helplessness and having received unexpected generosity that specifically addresses my needs.</p>

<p>I can feel the generosity now in the whole body as I’m eating, like a warm feeling, soft and calming. There’s no room for oppression, anger, ill will or aversion. But it’s much less now than the first time it really made an impact, which was when I sat in the car the first time, heading towards the hospital. I felt ill. I didn’t know what my condition was, if it was very serious or not. Relieved, yet somewhat bewildered over the situation: that I’m unconditionally receiving this gift from people I’ve had very little direct communication with. That was their act of generosity toward me, an act they did not have to do. It is not within my right to speculate on their economical situation, but it’s probably not great. Yet they took me to the hospital on two consecutive days and there was never any mention of any sort of compensation. And now I’m eating the food they gave me. They’ll bring more tomorrow, they told me.</p>

<p>It has been good for me to experience the generosity in this way, in real life, not just from reading or listening. Having been, to a great extent, in need of help, and having receiving it, unconditionally, has deepened my understanding of the greatness of generosity. I should remember this for times when I am healthy and complacent. Learn from it to develop a greater sense of friendliness. Accept more people around me, even though they have no concern for the practice and they might prevent my practice from time to time. Monks are dependent on lay people. I too, need others around me. I will become dependent on others at certain times — I’m only lucky as long as I’m not.</p>

<p>I do not mean that I should grow dependent on them or weigh them down, make myself a weight on their mind. Rather, just that my attitude towards others should change. I should be aware of that we all need to live dependent on others, we all need others. And having people around that might disturb my practice is a trade-off I should allow. The practice is full of trade-offs. The great Ajahns also made these kind of trade-offs; instead of focusing on their own practice, there were times when they decided to teach or visit their old parents.</p>

<p>So if this particular family, for example, should invite me once again to their home for food, I should accept their offer — even though that would mean that I would be breaking the precept of not eating after noon.</p>

<p>I think that, for me, at this time, to receive that generosity would be much more beneficial than to keep to the precept, as long as I have a clear understanding of why the precept exists. That’s why the Buddha established the monk’s order as a convention. When you have the robes, it’s a convention, everybody then knows that they don’t eat after twelve. As a layman, I cannot expect others to understand this.</p>

<p>The precepts are not rules to blindly adhere to. They are rules to train with, to deepen wisdom and understanding around them. As for the precept of not eating after twelve, it’s a precept of restraint. So even if I’m breaking the precept as it is written, I’m not necessarily breaking the precept as a lay person accepting food in the evening as long as I’m very mindful when I eat that food; and to know, before I accept, that I’m not accepting it because because I’m craving for it; and when I eat the food, I should remember that this food is given as an act of generosity that I have accepted. That should be the only reason I eat it. If I, while eating it, notice pleasure from taste, I should abandon it immediately.</p>

<p>It’s hard to understand this generosity from just reading about it, or from artificially thinking about it. If I’m really in need of help when someone gives it to me, that’s when I really appreciate it and can feel it. Such as, when I haven’t eaten, when I need food. Or, if I’m unable to move, and I need to go to the hospital.</p>
