  <article class="post-content">
  <p>My name is Russell Limewood and this site revolves around my personal practice and pragmatic verification of the Buddha’s teachings — the Dhamma.</p>

<p>The source of information for my practice is based on the Pali Canon<sup id="fnref:canon"><a href="#fn:canon" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and the Theravada tradition: the oldest form of the Buddha’s teachings. Specifically the practical teachings of the Thai forest Ajahns of Venerable Ajahn Mun’s linage. Please see my <a href="/about/stance">stance</a> for further details.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-name-relatively-right-mean">What does the name Relatively Right mean?</h2>

<p>During the initial period when I first introduced myself to the teachings, by means of reading the suttas or books by the forest Ajahns, there were often words that came up that by themselves carry no meaning at all: words that need to be put in relation to something else to be able to convey their meaning. For example, words such as: <em>right</em>, <em>wrong</em>, <em>good</em>, <em>bad</em>, <em>skillful</em>, <em>ignorance</em> and <em>truth</em>. They are rather ambiguous on their own as they really can mean anything depending on the context of use.  In addition, weaker defined words such as <em>virtue</em> and <em>evil</em> where unclear to me as they needed to be put in perspective.</p>

<p>Among these, the word <em>right</em> was especially interesting to me since it is the first word in each and every one of the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path<sup id="fnref:path"><a href="#fn:path" class="footnote">2</a></sup>: Right View, Right Resolve, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. These eight factors outline the theoretic instructions on which students of the Dhamma base their practice in order to develop themselves toward the goal of the teaching. As my studies continued, the titles of the path factors repeatedly kept surfacing, and I gradually became vexed with the conspicuous word <em>Right</em>.</p>

<p>On a later occasion I was listening to a Dhamma talk by Ajahn Amaro where, during questioning, he actually receives this question regarding the meaning of word <em>Right</em> as part of each factor of the Path. I do not remember where or when this talk was given or what it was about. Writing this, I only vaguely remember the question and corresponding answer because they were  yet still on my radar at the time. So please forgive me for any misrepresentation of Ajahn Amaro’s answer. Though to the best of my recollection, the answer he gave was something along the lines of <em>Right</em> meaning, not in the sense of right or wrong as absolute rules to adhere to, but rather in the sense of putting a candle up straight. That is, there is only one right way that a candle can burn as intended.</p>

<p>This sounded good to me at first and I was rather satisfied by the answer although it still was a bit abstract. However, as time went on and I continued to immerse myself in the teachings, investigating and reasoning as I went along, I found that this simile was not satisfying enough for me. It was too vague for me to understand. I was still lacking a more concrete explanation in order to fill up the empty hole in my reasoning.</p>

<p>Quite some time later (possibly several years) it occurred to me that the word <em>right</em> when associated with the context of the Dhamma was to be understood as <em>right</em> concerning reaching the goal of the practice. In other words, <em>right</em> in relation to the path of development that leads to the goal — to where the path ends. Consequently, everything said to be <em>wrong</em> leads us away from the goal. So whenever <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em> is mentioned in Dhamma texts — which adhere to Dhamma — there is always this implicit connotation.</p>

<p>In the Noble Eightfold Path, each factor begins with the Pali word <em>Sammā</em> which generally translates to <em>Right</em> in English. Since the path encompasses all aspects of the teachings to be practiced in order develop oneself towards the goal, the inclusion of <em>Right</em> as part of each of the eight factors become important to be aware of. Why is that? Because the distinguishing head word of each factor may also exist on its own, without the addition of <em>Right</em> as a modifier. In this case, when <em>Right</em> is absent, the factors of the path become nothing else than plain wrong; that is, wrong with regard to the progress towards the goal of the Dhamma teaching.</p>

<p>As an example, the path factor of Right Mindfulness — when practiced correctly — is conducive to reaching the goal of the practice. But just “mindfulness” used on its own is not necessarily <em>right</em>.<sup id="fnref:mindfulness"><a href="#fn:mindfulness" class="footnote">3</a></sup> This is the difference between the mindfulness of true Dhamma practitioners and the mindfulness of interest by people that have no knowledge or regard for the Dhamma.</p>

<p>This discussion also gives light to the rather strange description of another path factor: Right Livelihood, which I also had some quarrels with as I first dug into the texts. It is  basically just defined as: Right Livelihood is not wrong livelihood. So again, Right Livelihood would be the act of whatever livelihood that leads towards the goal.</p>

<p>The word <em>evil</em> was also puzzling to me. I had always associated <em>evil</em> with murderers, thieves, etc; individuals with cruel intentions, possessed by extreme immorality. I was baffled and somewhat reluctant then to read that my own thoughts were evil too. How can my own thoughts be evil? These thoughts do not lead to progress on the path, they point in another direction. I most likely had the conceit of at least being virtuous enough to not be evil to others, let alone myself. As I have realized since then, the <em>right</em> virtue developed as part of the Noble Eightfold Path goes much further than I could have ever imagined. And as virtue is developed to become noble, it completely eradicates evil because noble virtue wishes happiness for everyone; it will point all to the <em>right</em> direction of the path — including oneself.</p>

<p>Then there is the word <em>truth</em>, which when mentioned in texts or talks, may be perceived as a statement of absolute fact: a truth expected to be accepted blindly without question. I found it rather discouraging and somewhat insulting. Fortunately, <em>truth</em> is relative in the context of the Dhamma. It refers to the truth of dukkha and the truth of the ending of dukkha (suffering, stress, unsatisfactoriness, discontent); <em>truth</em> is unconcerned with anything else. Phrases such as: “searching for the truth”, “accepting the <em>truth</em>”, “practicing in accordance with the <em>truth</em>”, and the like, all converge in the actionable tasks given in The Four Noble Truths<sup id="fnref:nobletruths"><a href="#fn:nobletruths" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, which are: comprehending <em>dukkha</em>, abandoning its cause and realizing its cessation by means of developing oneself in accordance with the <em>Right</em> factors of the Noble Eightfold Path. So The Four Noble Truths are relative truths. They are only true in relation to purifying the mind by ending all dukkha — again, the goal of the practice.</p>

<p>The final example I wish to put in perspective is the word <em>ignorance</em>. In context of the Dhamma, ignorance refers to no other ignorance than the ignorance of our own self-caused dukkha, and arguably also, the ignorance of the ending of that dukkha. In other words, ignorance of The Four Noble Truths (which <em>relativity right</em> connotation was discussed in previous section).</p>

<p>Presenting words like <em>truth</em> and <em>ignorance</em> outside the context of Dhamma or to people without knowledge in the teachings renders these words meaningless, up to the listener’s skewed perception and understanding to interpret them, which may very well lead to harm and misrepresentation of the Buddha’s teachings.</p>

<p>Now lets conclude this aspect of the meaning of Relatively Right by revisiting the candle analogy. Based on the viewpoints discussed thus far we can see that there is only one right way a candle can burn, but this right way is relative to the mechanics of the candle, how the candle is constructed, the truth of the candle if you will. So too, there is only one right way one can practice and develop oneself to reach the goal of the Dhamma teaching, but this right way is relative to the “mechanics” of Dhamma<sup id="fnref:dhamma2"><a href="#fn:dhamma2" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Another aspect of the name Relatively Right is the question of whether <em>right</em> as explained here is right for each of us. Why should we adhere to this <em>right</em> as a pointer for how we choose to live our life? What confidence do we have in this <em>right</em>? Doing the right thing means different things for different individuals.</p>

<p>This <em>right</em> is relative to the meaning we want to give life. It is not absolute as in the statement: “the meaning of life”. If we have enough conviction in the alleged goal of the Dhamma teaching, that we conclude to give the meaning of our own life to the practice in order to validate the goal, then our <em>right</em> meaning of life should align precisely with the <em>Right</em> factors of the path.</p>

<p>This is also a useful perspective to have as we encounter others whose <em>right</em> life differs from our own. This is related in the first entry written here: a story where two individuals, whose <em>right</em> compasses leads to different locations, crosses paths engaging in a friendly conversation.<sup id="fnref:relativelyright"><a href="#fn:relativelyright" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<hr />

<p>At this point I have mentioned two aspects of the meaning of Relatively Right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what <em>right</em> means as mentioned in context of the Dhamma</li>
  <li>the <em>right</em> between those who practice according to the Dhamma and those who do not</li>
</ul>

<p>But there is also a third aspect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the practical <em>right</em> as opposed to theoretical <em>right</em></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Consider two practitioners of the Dhamma. Even though they both practice in line with the Noble Eightfold Path, the <em>Right</em> factors of the path does not necessarily mean the same thing for the two individuals. This is due to their past actions and their current conditions. In particular cases, the <em>right</em> way for each practitioner can in fact be completely <em>wrong</em> for the other.<sup id="fnref:inconsistent"><a href="#fn:inconsistent" class="footnote">7</a></sup> But not to be dismissed: Hypothetically they would both ultimately reach the same goal. As long as they develop themselves by <em>rights</em> of their own practice — yet, in accordance with the <em>Right</em> way of the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

<p>In the spirit of my own <em>relatively right</em> practice, all that is written here which is based on my experience in the practice, is thus only valid for the time and place it was written, and for my current advancements on the path of practice. It may be perceived differently by other readers whose practice is further advanced, or not yet as advanced. This even applies for my future self, reading the posts made here, they may very well be incorrect at that time, due to my advancements on the path and insights gained. Nevertheless, at the time of writing, all words that are put down are true to the current conditions, insights and defilements of my mind.</p>

<hr />

<p>So in summary, whenever the word <em>right</em> is mentioned in these writings here, it always carries the connotation of <em>right</em> in relation to the issue of dukkha, and further, in relation to the path of practice leading to the goal of the ending of dukkha.</p>

<p>Lastly, I wish to emphasize and urge the reader, with respect to all three aspects given to the meaning of Relatively Right, to <em>please carefully consider everything mentioned here for yourself</em>.<sup id="fnref:kamalas"><a href="#fn:kamalas" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The Dhamma is a unique gift, given by the Buddha to us who are willing to practice it and see for ourselves. It would be terribly unfortunate if misrepresentations of the Dhamma would stem from any writings made here. Our stance on the Dhamma and our practice must be fully pragmatic.<sup id="fnref:stance"><a href="#fn:stance" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
