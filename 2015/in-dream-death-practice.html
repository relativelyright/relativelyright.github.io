<article class="post-content">
  <p>In a recent dream, I found myself on an airplane that had lost control and was on its way down, about to crash. Without pondering whether or not this would eventually lead to my death, the following thought occurred to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, let me die — an as good of a death, that I possibly can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, I was inclined to make my death experience as skillful as possible.</p>

<p>This determination was underpinned by my conviction that I already should have had developed a sufficient amount of skills, in preparation, to be able to tackle these kinds of situations.</p>

<p>There was a great sense of urgency to the matter since the plane was going down so there was no time to contemplate other themes; I had to go straight to the root causes.</p>

<p>I immediately put forth the following already self-established and theoretically understood chain of reasoning:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the inconstancy of all mental phenomena</li>
  <li>thus, everything dies all the time</li>
  <li>thus, there was no self there that could die</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though having contemplated inconstancy and not-self like this numerous times before, restating this line of thought helped me disassemble the “I” in “I will die”. As a result, my mind became calmer and more stable. This proved essential because there were a few attempts by the defilements to disturb my determination. They tried to persuade me to pick up the pieces of my dying “I” and reassemble them to be clung to as self again.</p>

<p>Fortunately the conditions were on my side and I managed to ignore them, whereafter the disappeared rather quickly. Had I listened to them though, they would surely have commanded the next herd of related defilements — e.g. anxiety and doubt — to attack and take control, in which case my in-dream death would have been unskillful, terrible and stressful.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I would say that I was successful, because the dream died before I did (in the dream). As a result of the dream’s sudden death, my previously limited and constrained awareness — having been bound by the dream — became released from its object of clinging (the dream) and began to spread in space around my body.<sup id="fnref:unbinding"><a href="#fn:unbinding" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Instantly all blatant stresses from the previous scenario disappeared and the mind attained a much more peaceful state.</p>

<p>At this point I had no speculations about whether I actually had died or not — because the dream itself had died instead of me — and I had now become fully aware of the preceding scenario. My eyes was still closed although I was awake (released from the dream).</p>

<h2 id="strengthening-conviction">Strengthening Conviction</h2>

<p>Shortly after this event, I analyzed the dream experience — and the process of its abandonment — as analogous to <a href="/lists/five-aggregates">The Five Clinging-Aggregates</a> — in terms of <em>their</em> abandonment, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dream died instead of me because — from within the dream — I disassembled it, un-fabricated it, un-sustained it; even though the dream was my reference point of experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same way, I compared the dream experience to the experience caused by the clinging-aggregates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could I, as I advance on the right path of practice — from “within” the clinging-aggregates — disassemble, un-fabricate, un-sustain the clinging to the aggregates; even though the clinging-aggregates are my reference point of experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expressed in a different way:</p>

<p>As the dream died from the lack of sustenance, in the same way, the clinging (to the aggregates) would die from being deprived of sustenance. And just as I awoke from the dream as a consequence of its death; so too, I could allegedly awake from the clinging-aggregates as a consequence of their death — i.e. awake from my experience of dukkha.</p>

<p>Now, was it really sensible to make a comparison like this? Did I gain any value from this line of thought or was it mere intellectual stimulus?</p>

<p>It gave me additional viewpoints that strengthened my conviction in the clinging-aggregates.</p>

<p>The assessments made in regard to the clinging-aggregates was founded on my already established understanding of them: a sort of understanding that comes from thinking. On the other hand, experiencing the dream dissolving as a result of my actions would count toward the sort of understanding that comes from developing, which is the highest sort of understanding.<sup id="fnref:sorts-of-understanding"><a href="#fn:sorts-of-understanding" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This understanding, gained from the dream arising and passing away, was consistent with the Dhamma; thus my strengthened conviction in the clinging-aggregates and their cessation.<sup id="fnref:inference"><a href="#fn:inference" class="footnote">3</a></sup> In fact, by extension, this means strengthened conviction in dukkha and the end of dukkha. In other words, strengthened conviction in all <a href="/lists/four-noble-truths">Four Noble Truths</a>, the whole of the teachings.</p>

<h2 id="reflecting-on-regret">Reflecting on Regret</h2>

<p>Besides the comparison to the five clinging-aggregates there was another noteworthy aspect of the dream: it gave a perspective of experiencing the moments before death.<sup id="fnref:dream-quality"><a href="#fn:dream-quality" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the conditions were in my favor in case of this dream, what will be the case when the actual moments before death arrives? Will the conditions be on my side? Will I be able to react to them skillfully? Or — will regret arise?</p>

<p>What sort of regret? The sort of regret that arise as a result from having (a level of) conviction<sup id="fnref:strengths"><a href="#fn:strengths" class="footnote">5</a></sup> in the Dhamma and its goal. It may formulate as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not having taken available opportunities to practice</li>
  <li>not having exerted enough effort</li>
  <li>not having prepared enough to be able to handle what is now imminent in a better way</li>
</ul>

<p>I sense a strong reaction to regret buried deep in my heart (regret in general). The thought of immense regret arising when my death is imminent has certainly occurred to me. Furthermore, this sort of regret has surfaced on a few occasions when I was under the impression of possibly dying. However, it does not have to be as crucial of a situation as death for this sort of regret to  arise. It might happen after a notification of a deadly illness, or as one finds oneself trapped under a house wreck, or head to head with a tiger, or sinking in quicksand, etc.</p>

<p>This sort of regret, that comes from practicing Dhamma, makes little to no sense in regard to those who are undoubtedly convinced that death is the annihilation of themselves. Why is that? For they are about to be annihilated, what difference does it make if their minds have developed or not? They might have regrets, e.g. of moral nature or because things did not turn out as they had hoped, but for whatever reasons unrelated to the goal of the Dhamma practice. This is the other sort of regret: regret that makes no sense in light of Right View.</p>

<p>In my case, I am certainly less than one hundred percent convinced that the death of the body brings about the annihilation of self. To me, the risk of <em>not</em> being annihilated cannot be ignored; that is, the risk of the process continuing cannot be ignored. By this reason regret makes sense. Whatever sustains the continuing process must be directed for the sake of happiness.</p>

<p>It is also stated by the Buddha in the texts that the current conditions and the conditions one creates (i.e., what one does) at the time around death are crucial for further becoming. So acting skillfully at the moment of death is very important, which is conceivable based on a good understanding of kamma.</p>

<p>The dream-experience provided additional incentive for me to reflect on regret and what I need to do to prevent this sort of regret from  arising in the future — a relief that there is yet time to do so.</p>

    <li id="fn:unbinding">
      <p>It seems reasonable that this will happen when the bounding factor is released. In this case, of course, awareness rapidly settled on another object to cling to, and thus was bound again. Please note though, that this is extremely simplified. The mind is clinging to numerous mental objects at any given time frame — binding itself in this manner. Only Nibbāna is complete unbinding according to the Buddha and the Arahants. <a href="#fnref:unbinding" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:sorts-of-understanding">
      <p>The sort of understanding that comes from developing, from seeing clearly, is the highest sort; it is less biased than understanding that comes from reading or thinking. See <a href="/lists/three-types-of-understanding">Three Types of Understanding</a> for more details. <a href="#fnref:sorts-of-understanding" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:inference">
      <p>Let: A: premise of the Dhamma and its goal; B: the dream experience; and C: the Clinging-Aggregates; and further: assume process of B equals C. Then, the sort of understanding gained from the dream experience points to that B conforms to A. Therefore C conforms to A. Uncertainty in the quality of the understanding that B conforms to A, and that B = C; turns the previous conclusion that C conforms to A into: increased conviction in that C conforms to A. <a href="#fnref:inference" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:dream-quality">
      <p>Although It was not a dream in deep sleep: I was probably about to wake up in the next tenths of minutes or so; I could direct my thoughts to a large extent, and decide how to react to things. That said, the clinging to the dream was sufficient enough to fabricate a convincing experience of it being real. <a href="#fnref:dream-quality" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
