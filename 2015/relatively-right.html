<article class="post-content">
  
<p>A citizen of The Great City in the north-west is outside of the city borders on errands one day. Passing over the south-eastern border he sees a wandering traveler. As the traveler is not heading in the direction of The Great City — as is the norm — the intensions of this peculiar traveler sparks the citizen’s interest.</p>

<p>Approaching the traveler, he initiates a conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Excuse me fellow traveler. I am a citizen of The Great City north-west from here. I once traveled here many years ago from the south. I assume you came from southern parts too?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And may I ask where you are headed? You are clearly not headed towards The Great City.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not. For the moment I am traveling north-east.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can see that. But what is your destination.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It may be referred to as the further destination.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have never heard of such place. What will you do when you reach it?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will call it my home.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So is it far from here? When do you expect to arrive?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is probably very distant, yes. My arrival is not guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen is unconvinced as to why such far travels are necessary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why are you aiming to reach such faraway location? All peoples wishes lies somewhere within the borders of The Great City. All travels end there. Mine did too. They have for centuries. This is the first time I have seen a traveler that is not headed towards it. Is not what you are searching for within the borders of The Great City?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And your destination? How do you know that it serves your wishes? Have you been there before?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its promise fulfills what I am searching for. I have never been there, no.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who promises? Where have you heard of this place?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have heard of people that supposably live there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you met any of these people?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No. Although I have met a few other travelers — with the same destination — who in turn have met people who were said to live there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So this is all the information you have? Can you trust these travelers?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though I greatly respect and have conviction in some of these travelers, I cannot completely trust them, no.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems very unwise and risky to take on such travels based on this sparse and uncertain information. Did they give you directions at least?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, these directions have been passed down from traveler to traveler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen suspects this is a bad idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So now you are following directions which you do not know if they are valid because they were given by people you cannot trust. In addition, the source of the directions are unknown. How do you know if your supposed destination — your future home as you say — even exists?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not know. With regard to this uncertainty involved with the given directions and the destination itself, I am honestly aware of that the destination is indeed a hypothesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen is perplexed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So let me see if I understand you correctly: not only do you not know if your destination exists — you are still willing to possibly spend your whole life reaching it?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time the citizen does not rule out the possibility that the traveler might be a full-fledged fool:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can you go on with such uncertainty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler notices the citizen’s concern and resolves to explain his strategy thoroughly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Directions do not have to be either correct nor incorrect. Parts of them can be correct while other parts can be incorrect. There can also be correct parts but the person following them do not understand or misinterprets them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, I would agree to not rule out the possibility of the directions being correct; nevertheless, I am yet wondering how one can proceed in a wise manner on such loose grounds?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good directions also describe objects as they occur along the way. For example: “head straight until you see a barn, there you should turn left at the crossing”. Upon reaching this specific point you can determine — to some extent — that that part of the directions were correct, which in turn strengthens the conviction that the directions at least have some validity to them. Of course this could be any barn at any crossing. But after iterating this type of verification process, the conviction of the validity of the directions as a whole — or at large — increases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is also another aspect to it. Some of the destination’s promising factors — as they have been described to me — are said to be gradually crystallizing the closer to the destination you reach. It is a similar experience to when you are far north and travel south, it gradually gets warmer. You would know you are traveling south.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler concludes his explanation by emphasizing the importance of meticulousness and self honesty:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keeping in mind though — there will never be any unexplored distinct direction further ahead that can be taken as correct in advance. Starting off you intentionally establish each direction as assumed correct — or possibly unlikely correct — using your current skill set. In the case of following through — only then — are there grounds for reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen is still reluctant to accept the traveler’s intentions as something worth the effort as opposed to entering The Great City.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So you can use a pragmatic approach. But fact remains — without any concrete evidence of the destination — time is your enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler concurs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes friend, you are indeed correct. Aging is always present and my death may come at any time. I must not lose focus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen becomes concerned and compassionate for the traveler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me remind you, dear fellow traveler, that you can apply for residency in The Great City right now without much further effort on your part. I have good news. I am in fact a member of the city council. I can take you there immediately and we can arrange for your stay.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thank you for your offer but as I said, I have no interest in living there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if you die without having reached your destination? When near the hour of your death, what would you do? A wasted life for sure. I fear you will regret yourself deeply.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you suppose my regrets would be?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Missing out on the opportunities, happiness and love in The Great City. Its citizens form a loving and generous community.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see. Well there was a time when I was indeed aspiring to settle within the borders of The Great City. Since then my views have changed as a result of being unsatisfied with inherent qualities in The Great City itself.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> These qualities constitutes a subset of the causes for my changed views.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler continues his reasoning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why would I regret missing out on The Great City and its wonders — when those themselves — were part of the causes that led me to search for a further destination to begin with? It is against logic, against reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You would realize that the stubbornness and pride of holding on to your changed views cost you your good life in The Great City. You would desperately wish for another chance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s say that when lying in my deathbed — near the last hour of my life — I am given the gift of youth and taken back to this exact location where we now stand. Having experienced the failure of my earlier travels, it would be another chance to enter The Great City and prosper in life there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But you would not enter, would you? I have seen mules less stubborn.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would not. The Great City is simply not to my satisfaction.<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> So on the contrary: I would argue that I would regret myself deeply near the hour of my death, if I had not taken upon myself to honestly search for my current destination.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And in the case you were shown — in an undeniable way — that your destination did not even exist? You would be a fool to continue on your travels.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, in such case I should interrupt my search, realize that the assumption of my destination was false, and discard the hypothesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find this very likely to happen. In this case you would definitely have wasted your life wandering in vain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I disagree. For me, it is not only the destination of my travel that is right, but also the traveling itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen disapproves of the travelers selfishness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You say. Seems like you are just thinking of yourself and your traveling. Do you just wander along with no regard for others?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If that were the case, how could I consider the traveling itself to be right? Furthermore, there are times that I temporarily interrupt my traveling for the benefit of others. Is not that what I am doing right now?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, I suppose I have been asking a lot of questions. It is getting late.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>May I conclude our friendly discussion because it is indeed darkening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen nods. The traveler concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me ask you — we both came here from the south — would you go back?</p>
</blockquote>

<!--
> Let me ask you. 

> We both came here from the south. Would you go back?

> Let me ask you, as we both came from the south. Would you ever want to go back?

> Let me ask you — we both came here from the south — would we consider returning?
-->

<blockquote>
  <p>I would not. I travelled here because I came to an understanding that it is not an appropriate way of life in those areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And neither would I. All people in the north share this common view. We all traveled northward because we individually developed the understanding that life in the north is more valuable, more right.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, the northern areas was the right destination for us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler brings up the multitude in the north:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the north is not small. There are several smaller cities south of The Great City where travelers have settled.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, some settle in the suburbs, they do not continue to The Great City, that is their right.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--
> Well some settle in the suburbs, at least for a while, that is their right.

> Well yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. These travelers decided to not continue to The Great City, that’s their right.

> Well yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. Some travelers decided to settle there, it is their right.

> Yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. These travelers decided to settle there by their own right.  

> Yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. Travelers settle there, at least for a while. It is what they feel is right for them. But the tendency for most is to migrate further and further towards The Great City.

> Yes, some stay there, at least for a while. It is what they feel is right for them. But the tendency is to migrate further and further towards The Great City.
-->

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, but even within The Great City there are differences in cases of what is considered right; there is a strive for what is individually right; there are individual forces of right. As a member of the city council, do you agree?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, the preferences of citizens in our city may differ. Some citizens prefer to live in the center part, some rather stay in calmer neighborhoods, and their choice of livelihood varies in a large range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler reminds the citizen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But even so — in the presence of these differences — there is still the common fundamental understanding of “right” among all citizens of the north. It forms the basis for living together.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--
> But even so, the common fundamental understanding of right among all people that have travelled to the north is what form the basis for living together. 
-->

<p>The citizen chimes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Especially in The Great City. It is what makes The Great City great. Our common understanding indeed provides the basis for our individual differences to thrive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traveler continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And one could further argue that the individual differences is a support for the community. If everyone had the same preferences of “right” there would be communal areas of lacking functionality. As a member of the city council, do you agree?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Agreed. Our differences in what we see as “right” is effectively contributing to the city and gives it its variety. But as you say, as long as we adhere to our common understanding of “right”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To conclude our discussion. I will continue traveling to my destination. And on success, I will pass on my revised directions where they are asked for. I will have done the right thing for myself and contributed by assisting others doing their rights in case they align with mine. In case of failure, I will recognize that. It is nevertheless a contribution. It is homogenous with the process within your city.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--
Just like in the city, right?

Yes, in this way the city develops along the lines with what communally consider is right.

And for each individual, such as myself, it is how I develop along the lines with what I consider is right.
-->
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, it is how the city develops along the lines of what we consider is right.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And it is how I develop in line with what I consider is right.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goodbye traveler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizen lights his lantern and walks back towards the city.</p>
