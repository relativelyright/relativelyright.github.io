<p>As progress is made during practice I will eventually come upon and reveal new and unfamiliar mental territories: conditions where a set of ordinary attachments have diminished, where craving and clinging have weakened. This is expected and in accordance with the path of practice. However, this unfamiliar new realm gives sudden rise to defilements that knock me off my feet. Consequently, I find myself back on familiar grounds and the current progress on the path is interrupted.</p>

<p>This happens when I have completely lost my mindfulness. For a moment, I do not remember — I have no idea — what I am doing, or why I am doing it.</p>

<p>What are these defilements? I will classify and refer to them as the <em>defilements of unfamiliarity</em>; attached destructive mental qualities, triggered by the cessation of the ordinary; by going where one has never (or rarely) gone before.</p>

<p>I will look into how a sense of delight can help prevent these situations, which in turn, leads to the importance of remembering just that: to be able to make use of delight when necessary.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="origination">Origination</h2>

<p>I will start off by describing the particular occasion from which these writings originate.</p>

<p>I had been re-examining and iterating the sutta <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.020.than.html"><em>Vitakkasanthana Sutta: The Relaxation of Thoughts</em>⟶</a>. The discourse gives four techniques to calm down, weaken and diminish unskillful thoughts: thoughts that lead to suffering, stress, harm, unsatisfactoriness, etc. The ending paragraphs describe a person who has culminated in one or more of these techniques:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He thinks whatever thought he wants to, and doesn’t think whatever thought he doesn’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, having determined to attempt to calm down and weaken a set of my own harmful, unskillful thoughts; an unusual amount of time had passed without these thoughts arising. I was outside of my mental comfort zone.</p>

<p>It is in this condition that the defilements of unfamiliarity arose and took me back to unprogressive and destructive familiarity again.</p>

<p>A few seconds later though, I remembered another discourse I had recently read: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.028.than.html"><em>Ariya-vamsa Sutta: The Discourse on the Traditions of the Noble Ones</em>⟶</a>. The following sentence in the description of the fourth tradition came to mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, the monk finds pleasure and delight in developing (skillful mental qualities), finds pleasure and delight in abandoning (unskillful mental qualities).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in my case, since I was “relaxing unskillful thoughts”, it would count as finding pleasure and delight in abandoning unskillful mental qualities.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that the very reason I was thrown off by my defilements in the first place, was a result of having abandoned unskillful qualities — the result of having done what I intended to do. However, I did not do so while “finding pleasure and delight”.</p>

<p>The defilements that arose as a result of that abandonment (in the absence of mindfulness), were too strong and convincing and led me to think (subtle, implicit) thoughts in terms of: “Why am I doing this?”, “Why don’t I do what I usually do?”, “This is not useful”. And instead of continuing the maintenance of the abandoning I once had started, I interrupt it right there, and “un-abandon” the mental qualities.</p>

<p>Just as if a person having been blind for that persons whole life — 30 years, 40 years — would suddenly be able to see again, and after a certain time of experiencing vision would get uncertain, confused and disoriented, thinking: “Why am I doing this?”, “Why don’t I do what I usually do?”, “This is not useful”. And so that person withdraws to the comfort of blindness, continues to dwell with eyes closed, not taking the opportunity that is clearly available to develop further.</p>

<h2 id="incentive">Incentive</h2>

<p>So what sparked my interest when recollecting the forth tradition given in the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.028.than.html"><em>Ariya-vamsa Sutta</em> ⟶</a> at that moment — when I realized my defeat — was that if I had been mindful of that I was indeed doing a good task of abandoning as the defilements arose, could I have delighted in that? Would this have lessened the power of these defilements — maybe diminished them completely for the time being? Or enough, anyway, to continue abandoning or maintaining the abandonment?</p>

<p>When the point comes that I get confused about abandoning and I have lost mindfulness, if I can then remember to delight in that abandoning, it would feel much better, because I know I am doing the right thing, in accordance with my previous intentions.</p>

<p>This has happened countless times for me in my practice. And I am quite sure that, the vast majority of the times, I am unaware of it.</p>

<p>And that’s when I  really need to remember to delight in that, because if I forget, I might be taken over by the defilements and the progress will stop. I will close my eyes just like the blind person above.</p>

<p>Note that I am not referring to the delight itself but rather the mindfulness of delighting, i.e. the importance of being able to remember to delight in times of hardship and weakness.</p>

<p>I identify four factors at play here, that needs to be investigated. They can be further grouped into enemies and friends.</p>

<p>The enemies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The set of defilements: aka the defilements of unfamiliarity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Handpicked from the description of the fourth tradition, the good friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delight.</li>
  <li>Wisdom: When to find delight and appropriately associate it with developing and abandoning as is fitting.</li>
  <li>Mindfulness: remember to find pleasure and delight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each factor here has their own set of strengths and weaknesses. They fight over and over again.</p>

<p>But before that, lets make some words clear.</p>

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>In the light of the matter in hand, there are a few important keywords and phrases in the fourth tradition of the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.028.than.html"><em>Ariya-vamsa Sutta</em> ⟶</a> which are in demand of attention.</p>

<p>It is appropriate to briefly describe my interpretation and understanding of these; as the comprehension and correctness of concluding thoughts depend on them, I hope to avoid ambiguities and unnecessary misunderstandings.</p>

<p>For recollection here is the excerpt again, it is extremely concise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, the monk <strong>finds</strong> <strong>pleasure</strong> and <strong>delight</strong> in <strong>developing</strong> (<strong>skillful</strong> mental qualities), <strong>finds pleasure</strong> and <strong>delight</strong> in <strong>abandoning</strong> (<strong>unskillful</strong> mental qualities).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please note that the point here is not to analyze the sutta per se, but rather for the sake of the discussion ahead. Forthcoming use of these words are based on the following elucidation.</p>

<h3 id="find--delight">Find &amp; Delight</h3>

<p>When mentioned, these words come coupled together:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… finds pleasure and delight…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can not clearly distinguish between the meaning of the words <em>pleasure</em> and <em>delight</em>; looking through dictionaries, their definitions are very similar. I am curious to why Than Geoff (translator) uses both words when to me, one of them would suffice.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Unfortunately I unable to derive this from the original source by reason of my limited knowledge in the Pali language.</p>

<p>In line with my understanding of the quote above, and on the inclusion of the word <em>find(ing)</em>, which points to that delight arises as a cause rather than a result. That is, <em>finding</em> implies that delight is intentionally generated by exertion.</p>

<p>Based on this interpretation I will assume the following distinguishing definition between these words:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delight is intentionally generated by exertion.</li>
  <li>Pleasure originates as the result of other causes; it has no intentional element.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, I will henceforth omit the word <em>pleasure</em> and only use <em>delight</em> when referencing this sutta.</p>

<h3 id="developing-and-abandoning">Developing and Abandoning</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>… delight in developing (skillful mental qualities)<br />
… delight in abandoning (unskillful mental qualities)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, <em>skillful</em> mental qualities lead towards the goal, <em>unskillful</em> ones lead away from the goal. What qualities are skillful is subject to the individual, his/her attainment on the path of practice, his/her wisdom/discernment. What is skillful at one time may be unskillful at another time and vice versa.</p>

<p>The earlier classified “defilements of unfamiliarity” are clear examples of unskillful mental qualities.</p>

<p>The rationale here is a clear-cut: develop what is skillful, abandon what is not.</p>

<p>In regards to the terms <em>abandoning</em> &amp; <em>developing</em> themselves, I interpret them as encompassing the full gradual range from a momentary appliance up towards a continuous appliance<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A short-term abandonment is an equally long suppression of the targeted mental qualities; a longer-term abandonment is, accordingly, a suppression for equally long time; a permanent abandonment is the complete destruction of the targeted mental qualities.</p>

<p>This applies to development as well: a short- and longer-term development is the culmination of whatever skillful qualities lasting for the respective time, after which they fade; a permanent development is the complete cessation of all unskillful mental qualities (fetters).</p>

<p>What we see as abandoning or developing here is merely a concept; in the end, they actually refer to one and the same thing: progress on the path. One may choose to see something as abandoning, or as developing. It is just how we conceptualize these terms. More on this later.</p>

<h3 id="right-delight">Right Delight</h3>

<p>Combining the two sections above yields <em>right</em> delight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delighting in <em>developing skillful</em> qualities.</li>
  <li>Delighting in <em>abandoning unskillful</em> qualities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, <em>wrong</em> delight would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delighting in <em>developing unskillful</em> qualities.</li>
  <li>Delighting in <em>abandoning skillful</em> qualities.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is clearly important to distinguish. “Wrong” delight is referred to in a number of suttas, for example in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.131.than.html"><em>Bhaddekaratta Sutta: An Auspicious Day</em>⟶</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And how does one not place expectations on the future? One does not get carried away with the delight of “In the future I might have such a form”… “feeling”… “perception”… “thought-fabrication”… “consciousness”…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In upcoming discussions, whenever <em>abandoning</em> or <em>developing</em> are mentioned, they will always connote unskillful mental qualities and skillful mental qualities, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>

<p>Having looked at the enemies, the unskillful mental qualities, now I will look into the friends, namely: <em>delight</em>, <em>wisdom</em> and <em>mindfulness</em>. These are the factors that will aid in following through with the depiction in the fourth tradition.</p>

<h3 id="delight">Delight</h3>

<p>As stated in the origin section, my hope is that delight will help keep the continuation of the practice by assisting in holding back the defilements. But what is delight really? As established above, it is created by exertion. But what is it essentially? Nothing but a perception. It needs wisdom.</p>

<h3 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h3>

<p>Wisdom revolves around the content words given in the fourth tradition, namely:
<em>finds</em>, <em>delight</em>, <em>developing</em> and <em>abandoning</em>. Even though the terminology of these words have been lightly covered, they need to be more deeply investigated as it is wisdom’s role and mission to make sure to do the right thing, at the right time, as needed to adhere to the fourth tradition.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Knowing <em>developing</em> and <em>abandoning</em>, which implies that it knows <em>defilements</em> (to some extent).</li>
  <li>Knowing whether <em>developing</em> or <em>abandoning</em> is in play (dominantly active / operative).</li>
  <li>Knowing the benefits of <em>delight</em>.</li>
  <li>Knowing <em>finding</em>, i.e generation by exertion.</li>
  <li>Knowing when and how to <em>find</em> <em>delight</em>.</li>
  <li>Knowing how to appropriately directing <em>delight</em> to either <em>developing</em>, <em>abandoning</em>.</li>
  <li>Knowing the appropriate time to wait in familiarity before switching to the next unfamiliarity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abandoning-and-developing-range-of-difficulty">Abandoning and Developing: Range of Difficulty</h4>

<p>To recap, abandoning refers to the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities; developing, refers to skillful mental qualities.</p>

<p>One could argue that it is much easier to develop skillful qualities than it is to abandon unskillful qualities. Why is that? It’s the unskillful qualities that has a hold on us, that we are attached to, that we find “dear and appealing”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. When abandoning unskillful qualities, we are going against the defilements, performing some kind of renunciation, and there’s a tension there.</p>

<p>Is this true, or are there cases where abandoning is easy?</p>

<p>Well, some unskillful qualities are actually not hard to abandon: those that are clearly causing suffering and are not that dear and appealing. In other words, the areas where wisdom has matured and has surpassed the corresponding defilements. What is “clearly causing suffering” is relative to the persons discernment and position on the path of practice (wisdom, virtue and concentration) — i.e. the strength of wisdom in opposition to the strength of the defilements. Based on this, one can say that there’s both hard and easy abandoning.</p>

<p>Is this true for developing as well? Is there hard and easy development? Are skillful mental qualities easy or hard to develop?</p>

<p>Both. Some are easy; some are hard. Depends on the past and current conditions. For example, for a particular person, a certain level of generosity (as a skillful mental quality) might be very easy to develop, whereas a level of patience or determination could be much harder. So there’s also a range of difficulty in play in this case: in regard to developing.</p>

<p>How about in general terms ? Which one is more difficult: <em>abandoning</em> or <em>developing</em>? Or are they both equally difficult?</p>

<p>When <em>developing</em>, we are creating instances of skillful mental qualities. When <em>abandoning</em> however, we are destroying instances of unskillful mental qualities. Moreover, we are attached to these mental qualities, we are facing our defilements, doing some kind of renunciation, which creates tension. Hence it is tempting to argue that abandoning would be more difficult since we are breaking attachments, trying to alleviate the tension, whereas developing is the much easier reverse: taking on skillful qualities. But trying to develop can also be hard. So we have no basis on which we can say that abandoning is harder than developing. However there are occasions — and sometimes longer periods — in the training when abandonment is the most apparent factor. In these cases one might mistakenly think abandonment is more difficult since it’s more often surfaced. But again, the same goes for development.</p>

<p>How about in terms of beneficience, would one benefit more from abandoning than developing? Which task is more valuable and rewarding — short and long term? Will one advance faster if abandonment is focused on?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. As an overly simplistic example, lets say X number of unskillful qualities are abandoned. That is great. But now lets say the skillful quality of Y was developed instead. In comparison, if Y results in the abandoning of 2 times X, then that <em>development</em> of Y was certainly more beneficial than the <em>abandoning</em> of X.</p>

<p>So in terms of these words <em>abandoning</em> and <em>developing</em>, there is really no inherent reason why one should focus more on abandoning than on developing, or vice versa. There is no advantage of abandoning over developing, they are both equally beneficial. But there surely is a scale of difficulty involved, ranging from easy to hard, in relation to both abandoning and developing, that is a function of the strength of wisdom. Whether it is easy or hard depends on the battle between the defilements and wisdom — between the enemies and the friends. Whoever is stronger wins. If defilements are weak, it will probably be easy for wisdom to win. If defilements are strong, wisdom needs to be stronger.</p>

<h4 id="conceptualizing-abandoning-and-developing">Conceptualizing Abandoning and Developing</h4>

<p>Knowing that there are two possible routes to act upon the fourth tradition — either delighting in abandonment or delighting in development — how do one choose which route to take?</p>

<p>As briefly mentioned earlier, <em>abandoning</em> is just a categorization of <em>developing</em>: when we are abandoning we are developing. The abandonment is development in itself because transitioning from X unskillful qualities to X - 1 is progress, and <em>development</em> is also progress. Development is a categorization of abandonment in the same way. Depends on how you say it. You may say: “I am developing the path”; or: “I am abandoning my defilements”. Both terms denote progress towards the supposed goal of the training/teaching.</p>

<p>So what we do when we say that we are <em>abandoning</em> or <em>developing</em> we are creating a concept of these words rather than referring to the actual mental activity that is the literal description in the <em>fourth tradition</em>.</p>

<p>This concept gives us a perception that we can hold on to as a means of simplifying and abstracting either <em>abandoning</em> or <em>developing</em> in order to subsequently find delight and associate with the concept.</p>

<p>To be able to correctly — in real time — determine whether the current metal processes conform to the literal description of abandonment or development is much too complex for the state of mind we are in when applying the <em>fourth tradition</em> (non-appliance will be discussed later). Even if there was such a case that at a given moment there would be only abandonment of unskillful qualities or development of skillful qualities in operation — even so — the next moment can be completely different. So it is really necessary to abstract the intricacies of the mind to a higher level concept; a concept of either abandoning or developing which lasts longer and that we can then use as a target for directing delight.</p>

<p>As mentioned, sometimes the developing is apparent; sometimes the abandoning is apparent. This is the more passive/automatic conceptualization that one can notice. As this concept then is already “in the air” one can immediately direct delight there.</p>

<p>There is also the more active/intentional case where one decides to look at something as abandonment or development, possibly changing the previous concept.</p>

<p>So, it’s entirely up to oneself to freely choose whether to see something as an abandonment or a development for the sake of directing delight; utilizing the fourth tradition.</p>

<h4 id="exertion-of-delight-range-of-difficulty">Exertion of Delight: Range of Difficulty</h4>

<p>When it comes to <em>finding delight</em> one must have the concept of <em>abandoning</em> or <em>developing</em> already available as a target for association.</p>

<p>Similar to the act of <em>abandoning</em>/<em>developing</em>, there is a gradual range of difficulty involved when <em>finding delight</em>. It may be easy sometimes; at other times, much more difficult.</p>

<p>What determines if it’s easy or hard in this case however is not wisdom’s strength against the strength of the defilements; it is one’s level of right view and comprehension towards the currently targeted concept of <em>abandoning</em>/<em>developing</em>.</p>

<p>In the case of having established a concept of that one is <em>abandoning</em>, the level of comprehension of the drawbacks of the unskillful mental qualities that are being abandoned determines the level difficulty to <em>find delight</em>. In regards to the concept of <em>developing</em>, it is the comprehenison of how beneficial the skillful mental qualitites being developed are for future training.</p>

<p>So again, similar to <em>abandoning</em>/<em>developing</em>, it’s one’s advancements on the path of practice that provide the skill to exert delight.</p>

<h4 id="summarize">Summarize</h4>

<p>What differs between <em>abandoning</em> and <em>developing</em> in these permutations (moving vertically across rows), is the current concept of abandoning and developing. When there’s no concept of abandoning or developing, even though actual abandonment or developing may be taking place, there is no abandonment/developing in terms of fourth tradition.</p>

<p>What determines <em>hard</em> from <em>easy</em> <em>abandonment</em>/<em>development</em> is the strength of the defilements as opposed to wisdom.</p>

<p>What determines <em>hard</em> from <em>easy</em> <em>delight</em> (moving horizontally across columns)? Is what determines hard/easy abandonment/development and hard/easy delight the same thing or different things?</p>

<p>No, its all wisdom. But different appliance of wisdom. Wisdom’s strength against the defilements determines whether it is hard/easy to abandon/develop (abandonment/development in turn depends on the concept). Wisdom’s ability to exert delight in the presence of the current mental conditions determines whether it is hard/easy to delight (delight itself depends on the perception).</p>

<p>Direct the delight to what is fitting. If abandonment makes more sense and is most helpful in the current case, direct the delight there, and vice versa.</p>

<p>As seen, wisdom plays an important role in that it pulls the content words (<em>finds</em>, <em>delight</em>, <em>developing</em>, <em>abandoning</em>) given in the <em>fourth tradition</em> together.</p>
