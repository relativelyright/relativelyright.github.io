        <title>Generosity Deepened</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three weeks ago:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt a lot of generosity from a certain family these last few days. They’ve been transporting me back and forth to the hospital, attending to me there, and waiting for me while I was being examined and talked to the doctor. And last evening they came, unannounced, with a kettle of soup and some bread for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got to know the father from this family during the last three years, but I’ve barely been at their home, only a few times, perhaps three times. I’ve been invited many times, but always declined because they always included eating and they were always in the evening. So I’ve had very little contact with the remaining part of the family, which were the ones who actually took me to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How come they offered to help? Did I ask them? No, I didn’t. I spoke with the father, however, to get information regarding commercial form of transport. He them, without hesitation, offered to help. He offered in a way that was completely without boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course we will take you. I will help. No problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His response, of course, is also partly because of my previous good kamma with them. I’ve always treated them with good will and been sensitive to their suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am eating the soup that they gave me, I’m reflecting on that they didn’t have to give me anything, but they did it anyway. I didn’t ask for it. This is how a monk feels everyday; this is the way it is for a monk everyday as he gets his food. If this was the only food I got, if I got all my food in this way everyday, I would be extremely grateful. I am more sensitive to it now because I’m in that state of combined helplessness and having received unexpected generosity that specifically addresses my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel the generosity now in the whole body as I’m eating, like a warm feeling, soft and calming. There’s no room for oppression, anger, ill will or aversion. But it’s much less now than the first time it really made an impact, which was when I sat in the car the first time, heading towards the hospital. I felt ill. I didn’t know what my condition was, if it was very serious or not. Relieved, yet somewhat bewildered over the situation: that I’m unconditionally receiving this gift from people I’ve had very little direct communication with. That was their act of generosity toward me, an act they did not have to do. It is not within my right to speculate on their economical situation, but it’s probably not great. Yet they took me to the hospital on two consecutive days and there was never any mention of any sort of compensation. And now I’m eating the food they gave me. They’ll bring more tomorrow, they told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been good for me to experience the generosity in this way, in real life, not just from reading or listening. Having been, to a great extent, in need of help, and having receiving it, unconditionally, has deepened my understanding of the greatness of generosity. I should remember this for times when I am healthy and complacent. Learn from it to develop a greater sense of friendliness. Accept more people around me, even though they have no concern for the practice and they might prevent my practice from time to time. Monks are dependent on lay people. I too, need others around me. I will become dependent on others at certain times — I’m only lucky as long as I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean that I should grow dependent on them or weigh them down, make myself a weight on their mind. Rather, just that my attitude towards others should change. I should be aware of that we all need to live dependent on others, we all need others. And having people around that might disturb my practice is a trade-off I should allow. The practice is full of trade-offs. The great Ajahns also made these kind of trade-offs; instead of focusing on their own practice, there were times when they decided to teach or visit their old parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if this particular family, for example, should invite me once again to their home for food, I should accept their offer — even though that would mean that I would be breaking the precept of not eating after noon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that, for me, at this time, to receive that generosity would be much more beneficial than to keep to the precept, as long as I have a clear understanding of why the precept exists. That’s why the Buddha established the monk’s order as a convention. When you have the robes, it’s a convention, everybody then knows that they don’t eat after twelve. As a layman, I cannot expect others to understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precepts are not rules to blindly adhere to. They are rules to train with, to deepen wisdom and understanding around them. As for the precept of not eating after twelve, it’s a precept of restraint. So even if I’m breaking the precept as it is written, I’m not necessarily breaking the precept as a lay person accepting food in the evening as long as I’m very mindful when I eat that food; and to know, before I accept, that I’m not accepting it because because I’m craving for it; and when I eat the food, I should remember that this food is given as an act of generosity that I have accepted. That should be the only reason I eat it. If I, while eating it, notice pleasure from taste, I should abandon it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to understand this generosity from just reading about it, or from artificially thinking about it. If I’m really in need of help when someone gives it to me, that’s when I really appreciate it and can feel it. Such as, when I haven’t eaten, when I need food. Or, if I’m unable to move, and I need to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It brings to mind a story that Ajahn Jayasaro tells about what Ajahn Chah told him. Ajahn Chah said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you really knew the Buddha, Dhamma &amp;amp; Sangha, if you really understand the Buddha, Dhamma &amp;amp; Sangha, you would cry every time you bow before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I interpret that as if I really understood the first noble truth, then I would cry each time I bowed to them, each time I reflected on their generosity and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Hypocritical Mind</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;Around 18 months ago or so, the following thought occurred to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mind is constantly complaining, claiming that there’s never a quiet moment around here, that there always seem to be surrounding noise  appearing, in some form or another, disturbing the conditions for practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime later, however, when the surroundings actually got quiet and the &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; conditions became superb for practice — including the weather conditions, such as wind and temperature — I noticed that the mind itself was not quiet &lt;em&gt;internally&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing this, I realized that my mind was indeed a hypocrite: It was complaining about external noise, demanding a quiet environment to practice in, yet at times when surrounding conditions in fact were noiseless, it would nonetheless continue to engage in its own internal chatter, thus &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; disturb the conditions for practice. Isn’t that a typical symptom of hypocritical behavior? Traits of a hypocrite? I readily decided to treat it as such — because I knew this was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A problem, how so? These complaints were founded on the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of an ideal environment with overall surrounding conditions very suitable for practice. Now, if external sounds’ characteristics were not in compliance with the requirements set by this ideal — for example, sounds from hammering, a drill, a squeaky car — then they were instantly classified as noise. And since noise is unpleasant and disturbing, aversion arose in the mind whenever it made contact with what was perceived as noise. In response to the aversion, the mind reacted in a complaining manner. This was how the hypocritical complaints originated. Furthermore, with aversion as a preexisting condition, each subsequent complaint would sustain the aversion, nourish it, and tighten its grasp on the mind, and therefore increase the tendency for further complaints to arise in the future. There the problem: a vicious cycle, very detrimental to the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequence above starts with my overall willingness to practice but ends with the conditions for practice becoming worse. This was the influence of the defilements that cluttered my mind. They knew very well that they would be done away with if they were to allow the practice to continue. So naturally, they tried to prevent that from happening. In this case by making use of my willingness to practice to in fact worsen the conditions for practice. Very clever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the Dhamma within my mind is inclined to undertake the practice, which is good; but then the defilements, also roaming within the mind, have to rise up and resist in order to protect their longevity — doing so with whatever insidious trickery they can come up with. It was this conflict between the Dhamma and the defilements that brought about the hypocritical behavior mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-method&quot;&gt;A Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this realization, I determined that whenever my mind would complain and sustain aversion in this manner again, I would remind myself of its previous pattern of inconsistent behavior, and then confront it in such a way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Enough with this aversion! Stop complaining about the surrounding sounds that happen to disturb you. Let me remind you that when surroundings eventually turn quiet, as you now demand, you won’t be quiet yourself; you won’t take advantage of the opportunity. I’ve seen it. It’s a fact. Therefore you have no say — no right to complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any argument of this sort, constructed with the aim to reveal the mind’s ongoing hypocrisy for it to clearly see, I reasoned, would release it from its delusion, and consequently incline me to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stop all complaints and other harmful, aversive thoughts (internal sounds) immediately;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take advantage of the moment as an opportunity to step back and observe the aversion — its characteristics of impermanence, harmfulness and not-self — to gain insights and find motivation to practice; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduce the potential for this problem of complaints about noise — about external sounds that are out of my control — to arise again in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all favorable outcomes. But why did I assume that an argument like the above would serve as a countermeasure and actually result in these outcomes? Why wouldn’t the mind carry on with its ways as if totally unaffected? It would — if it weren’t for the qualities of honesty and integrity. Without honesty, the mind would never admit that it’s behaving hypocritically; without integrity, the mind wouldn’t have a problem with such inconsistent behavior to begin with. And because they challenge the defilements, both honesty and integrity count as part of the Dhamma within the mind. I was confident I had acquired enough of these good qualities in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this anti-hypocrite method consisted of two parts: firstly, to confront the mind with an argument that revealed its ongoing hypocritical behavior (a pattern already established); secondly, to rely on honesty and integrity (qualities already attained) to prevail and yield the above outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with this method, I began using it to address the complaining/aversion problem. And as planned, whenever the hypocrite appeared in response to external noise, it vanished as soon as it was revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not long after, at a moment free from external sounds, I observed the same hypocrite lurking around again: the mind absorbed and engaged in its own internal sounds, chattering along, self-entertained, and oblivious to (or possibly aware, but dismissive of) the — now ideal — surroundings. Perhaps my anti-hypocrite method wasn’t wholly anti-hypocrite after all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial reveal of the hypocrite was deduced from the mind’s inconsistent behavior in two &lt;em&gt;situations&lt;/em&gt;: the ideal situation just mentioned, where external conditions were satisfied; and the situation where they were not. I only considered the latter as I devised my method, because only non-ideal situations gave rise to the problem I was focused on — the problem of complaints and aversion. But after having recognized the hypocrite again, now during an ideal situation, I recalled that there was indeed a problem connected with ideal situations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of this second problem, the external conditions were already ideal so there was nothing to complain or be aversive about. Instead, the mind was oblivious to the favorable surroundings, or choosing to disregard them, or both. More deluded, you could say, than aversive. As a result, the mind became ungrateful, wasteful of time and energy, and reluctant to take advantage of the ideal situation. Essentially, the second problem was heedlessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my method, even though it did solve the first problem, it was not designed specifically to target that problem — or any problem at all. It was directed solely at the mind’s hypocritical behavior and downfall, and therefore effective against &lt;em&gt;whatever problem&lt;/em&gt; that would dissipate as a result. And because the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; hypocritical behavior was accompanying &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; problems — was deduced from &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; situations — the method was effective against both problems — in both situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments, however, needed to be specific to the problem at hand. Therefore, to address the second problem, I adjusted the arguments to point to heedlessness instead (as opposed to complaints and aversion). But I still had to make sure, following the method, to reveal the hypocritical behavior:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t you realize that it’s quiet now? If you could be quiet for just one moment and pay attention …. Why don’t you appreciate and take advantage of this opportunity now that the external sounds finally have disappeared? Or would you rather continue to engage in idle chatter that lead nowhere but to harm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;See, now it is quiet. This is what you wanted, wasn’t it? Didn’t you complain about this and that noise before? Then you better appreciate this opportunity and take advantage of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the second problem settled — the defilements having lost their control — I was free to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;acknowledge that the external conditions had changed and were now satisfactory;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;begin to appreciate the moment;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take advantage of the moment (by applying a suitable aspect of the training); and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduce the potential for this problem of heedlessness in the absence of external noise to arise again in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These outcomes of solving the second problem are notably similar to the outcomes of solving the first problem: they make way for and promote practice, they also make it clear what beneficial actions are obstructed by the hypocritical behavior. The similarities between both sets of outcomes further show that the method indeed was effective against both problems, that it therefore could handle both sides of the hypocrite, and that it therefore was useful in both ideal and non-ideal situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;still-in-use-today&quot;&gt;Still in Use Today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the method proved successful from the beginning and because the two problems have continued to arise, I have found no reason yet to stop using the method as it still benefits me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, at the time of writing this, it’s often a much quicker process. In such cases — if, for example, I notice the mind aversive and complaining in reference to external noise — it’s enough to raise a short and simple argument in the form of a question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it were quiet now, would the mind be quiet too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of having adopted the method now for the last 18 months (or so), the underlying defilements have weakened and can therefore be defeated more easily and quite automatically in a matter of a few seconds, simply by posing a short question like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another example of a present-day argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interesting. Aversion arose right now in response to that sudden sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the arguments constructed in the early stages of adopting the method, today’s arguments may seem inadequate with respect to the method’s requirements because they do not clearly identify and reveal the hypocritical behavior. While that may have been true 18 months ago, I am much more familiar with this particular hypocrite today — to the degree that these sorts of arguments, which merely nudge at either side of the mind’s inconsistent behavior, will suffice to recollect the whole concept of the hypocrite, and consequently reveal it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That explains why the process is quicker now: the arguments are allowed be shorter and less explicit while still conforming to the method. The actual construction of the arguments requires less effort too, making the process less energy-consuming. The given examples also show that the arguments have become less harsh; having gained broader and deeper knowledge of the hypocritical behavior and its detrimental effects, that harsh attitude — often included to enhance the arguments’ impact on the mind as a wake-up call — has naturally softened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, my mind is of course still not fully trained. And the untrained mind is still the ignorant mind, constantly changing as it’s reacting to feeling born of contact.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:dependent-arising&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:dependent-arising&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a result of its conditions changing in this way, my mind might very well become unstable/unsettled/uncertain to the degree that I’ll have to revert to explicit, full-length and possibly harsh arguments again in order to break through and reveal the hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though the process in general is quicker and more automatic today, it’s not always the case. Sure, there are aspects of mindfulness and discernment (those relating to the noise-hypocritical behavior) that have gained in strength, but I cannot sit back and rely on them to automatically resolve these matters on their own. Whatever the current state of mind, I have to take measures accordingly when constructing the arguments, making them explicit and verbose to the extent necessary for the method to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;formulation&quot;&gt;Formulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, the method is simple — it can be formulated as a sequence of three steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, there are two &lt;em&gt;sides&lt;/em&gt; of inconsistent behavior that constitute the mind’s hypocritical behavior:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one side (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;) that is a reaction to &lt;em&gt;non-ideal&lt;/em&gt; conditions, i.e. the mind complaining about external noise; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one side (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) that manifests during &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; conditions, i.e. when the mind, even though in the absence of external noise, itself isn’t quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What counts as “ideal”, of course, depends entirely on the mind’s current biases, lead by the defilements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As each side manifests, two particular &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt; arise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[for side &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;] the problem of complaints (call it &lt;em&gt;PA&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[for side &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;] the problem of heedlessness (call it &lt;em&gt;PB&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method is effective against both problems and therefore applicable in two typical &lt;em&gt;situations&lt;/em&gt;, each characterized by an active side together with its respective problem (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;PA&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;PB&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the non-ideal situation (when side &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is active) the method prescribes the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notice the &lt;em&gt;complaining&lt;/em&gt; mind as a result of external &lt;em&gt;non-ideal&lt;/em&gt; conditions (A + &lt;em&gt;PA&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Construct an argument against this side of the hypocrite (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;) that reveals it by referring to its other side (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reap the results and take further actions to advance practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly in the other situation (but now &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; is active so it switches with &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notice the &lt;em&gt;heedless&lt;/em&gt; mind as a result of external &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; conditions (B + &lt;em&gt;PB&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Construct an argument against this side of the hypocrite (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) that reveals it by referring to its other side (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reap the results and take further actions to advance practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick that outwits the defilements happens during step 2, when the hypocritical behavior is revealed by referring to its inactive side. That’s the crucial part. If omitted, the inactive side would be kept obscured by the active side and no hypocrite would be revealed. So, in both situations, the method takes advantage of the inactive sides to accomplish its purpose — regardless of whether the targeted problem is the complaining mind, or the heedless mind. Prior knowledge of both sides is therefore a necessary precondition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In step 3 the results are provided by good qualities previously attained from development on the path, honesty and integrity in particular. It’s also suggested to not be content with these results and instead aim to develop further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extends-to-time-and-place&quot;&gt;Extends to Time and Place&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve become more familiar with this behavioral pattern, I’ve begun to recognize its traits in situations other than those relating to sound. In fact, I’ve realized that the same pattern extends to &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;place&lt;/em&gt; as well. In other words, not only does the mind behave hypocritically as described — complaining in non-ideal situations and heedless in ideal situations — when in contact with the external sense object of sound, but additionally, the very same pattern is triggered as the mind comes into contact with certain ideas of time and place. In both cases, I recognize the pattern in the non-ideal situation, as I become aware of the problem of complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of time, the non-ideal is lack thereof: when there are chores awaiting or I have to attend to worldly matters, the mind complains and claims that there’s not enough time available for practice. It might even stir up a slight sense of panic by strongly suggesting that I cannot go on under these circumstances, that I need to make changes in order to free up more time. That’s not true though. There’s plenty of time available that I’m not, or at least not wholeheartedly, taking advantage of (e.g. chores can be excellent practice opportunities). What happens is, of course, that when time &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available, the mind doesn’t take advantage of it, doesn’t appreciate it, disregards it, doesn’t acknowledge it — is heedless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not until I begin to fully take advantage of every opportunity I have to practice, every window of available time each day — waking up, going to sleep, eating, relieving myself of that which I ate, moving from here to there, etc. — only then can I regard these complaints as valid; only then, should I decide whether structural changes are appropriate. But for now, I say this is clearly in line with the previous pattern of hypocritical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can describe how the pattern extends to place, I first need to clarify what I mean by “a place”. A place — is a specific area, that’s nearby, that’s accessible, and that can be both non-ideal and ideal depending on its surroundings. A place could be a path for walking meditation, a garden spot, under a tree; or a larger area such as a city quarter, a forest region; or indoors, for example a designated meditation room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a place is ideal or not depends on the mind’s biases in relation to surrounding sights, sounds&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sound-place&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sound-place&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, smells, and tactile sensations; and on the position of forms, such as a person, animal or inanimate object; and on social aspects as well. For example, if it’s raining, a walking path isn’t ideal. But if the rain stops, it becomes ideal. Then say a cow positions itself on the path, blocking the way — again, not ideal. And if other people are affected negatively as they see me doing walking meditation on the path — or if I am, as I become aware of them — then that would make it a non-ideal place too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So naturally, the mind complains that there aren’t any places around where I can practice; and it might also claim that I first need to make necessary arrangements to relocate to wherever there are ideal places readily available to me, and then — &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I’ll be able to practice. And of course, when these places’ surroundings change in such a way that they become ideal, the mind doesn’t take advantage of them, doesn’t appreciate them, disregards them, doesn’t acknowledge them — is heedless. That’s how the pattern extends to place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the method was devised based on this pattern it’s effective in these cases relating to time and place as well, because all ingredients of the method’s formula are still present, so nothing’s really changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are still the two sides of the same hypocritical behavior;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are still the same two problems;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there’s still a non-ideal situation, and consequently, an ideal one; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;because honesty and integrity are internal qualities, they remain unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all three steps in the method’s formulation are still feasible, which leaves four ways to carry out the steps as the pattern extends to time and place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reference to time, non-ideal situation: The mind complains about there being no time to practice (step 1). I argue that there are many periods of available time when the opportunity to practice is not taken advantage of (step 2). The complaints stop (step 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reference to time, ideal situation: There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; time available, but the mind is not taking advantage of the opportunity to practice, heedless (1). I remind the mind that it usually complains about there being no time to practice, and that now there actually is (2). The heedlessness stops (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reference to place, non-ideal situation: The mind complains about there being no good places around to practice (1). I argue that on occasions when there are, the mind is not practicing, heedless (2). The complaints stop (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reference to place, ideal situation: There are these good places to practice, but the mind is not practicing, heedless (1). I remind the mind that it usually complains about there being no good places around to practice, and that now there actually are (2). The heedlessness stops (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I initially used the method only to deal with the pattern relating to sound, I could not have conceived of using the method in cases relating to time and place as well. It makes me wonder to what further extent the method is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and place are very general areas, and there are therefore a large number of scenarios involving them where the method is useful. They are mental ideas, which means that they are one of the six external sense media. Sound, which is more blatant, is part of the other five. Following this line of thought, it’s not far-fetched that the method is effective in situations relating to the remaining four as well; that is, sights, smells, tastes and tactile sensations. If there are disturbing smells, for instance, the problem of complaints might arise. And at a later time, when there aren’t any smells that disturbs the mind anymore, the problem of heedlessness might arise as the mind acts hypocritically in the same way as it did in relation to noise. So, in addition to time and place, the method is useful in situations relating to all sensory contact, not just sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s yet another unexpected territory where I’ve recognized the hypocritical behavior and where the method has proven effective: I occasionally find myself wondering about other people’s views, how they can live their lives as they do, without Right View, without trying to deal with the dangers of aging, illness and death, which are undoubtedly coming their way. How are they content with burying this fact within themselves? And seconds later it strikes me — I am focusing on other people when I could attend to my own practice. I am no different, engaging in wrong views too — heedless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case is interesting because even though the problem of heedlessness clearly exists, the problem of complaints is not really apparent. I am not complaining, nor am I aversive as these thoughts occur to me. Yet the hypocritical behavior is present, so — according to the method’s formulation — the problem of complains must exist as well. If that’s the case, where are the complaints?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that the mind complains about other people’s wrong views; that, ideally, everyone should have Right View. But if this is the case, I am certainly not aware of it, and I find it extremely unlikely. I cannot imagine that this is true, that I’m so unreasonable and naive that I blame others as an excuse not to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the problem here isn’t the usual problem of complaints, what exactly is it? In this case, the complaints have shifted into bewilderment and confusion. Instead of complaining about noise, for example, I am unable to understand other people’s mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nevertheless, the method is still effective here — even though the problem of complaints is absent — because as soon as I recognize the hypocritical behavior, it’s immediately abandoned, after which I begin directing concern toward my own views and resolves instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method’s formulation, however, specifically mentions the problem of complaints, which means that the formulation doesn’t encompass all situations for which the method is effective, such as the given example. I have to refine the problem of complaints if I want the method’s formulation to be an accurate criterion for all cases when the method is useful. Its definition needs to be generalized to include both complaints and bewilderment, as well as any other currently unknown characterization of this kind of problem. According to the formulation, the kind of problem I am looking to describe is one that arises as a reaction to the non-ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more accurate description of this problem is: &lt;em&gt;A problem, that arises in the non-ideal situation, which upon recollection in the ideal situation, after the problem of heedlessness has been recognized, reveals the hypocritical behavior.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the problem of complaints refined, I can get a more accurate understanding to which extent the method is useful. The next question I ask myself is if the method can be used as I develop further along the path. Is it a method that is effective all the way to arahantship, to where the path ends? Or is it only appropriate around my current level of development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze this, I have to look at the formulation of the method again and investigate its prerequisites. As long as its prerequisites can exist, the method should be applicable. The prerequisites are essentially two: the hypocritical behavior; and honesty and integrity. So how far along the path can they be found?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypocritical behavior is formed from the two inconsistent sides described in the formulation, which when manifest, gives rise to the two problems. So the possibility for the hypocritical behavior to exist, depends on whether these two problems can arise. Therefore, the next question I have to ask myself is whether these two problems actually can arise during the whole path of development. In terms of the problem of heedlessness, the answer is yes. If one is heedless, one does not practice, and only practice will lead to the end of the path. For this reason, the problem of heedlessness can arise anywhere along the path.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:noactofwill&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:noactofwill&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As for the other problem — previously referred to as the problem of complaints — its refined definition is now based on the problem of heedlessness, so this problem can arise whenever the problem of heedlessness can. Consequently, since these two problems can arise, so can the hypocritical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for honesty and integrity, the second prerequisite, although they are not explicitly part of the Noble Eightfold Path, or any of the seven sets&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:seven-sets&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:seven-sets&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, they are fundamental for the whole practice. If one wants to reach the end of the path, one must observe one’s actions with honesty and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this reasoning, the method’s prerequisites can exist during the whole path of practice (at least while on the mundane level of the path), which means that I should be able to use the method on those occasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I mentioned in the beginning, that the hypocritical behavior in relation to noise was the result of the conflict between the Dhamma and the defilements within the mind — that’s not always the case. This conflict can certainly occur without it resulting in a hypocritical behavior. So just that fact is not sufficient grounds for applying the method. There has to be the problem of heedlessness on the one hand, and the opposing problem that creates the hypocritical behavior on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though the above reasoning suggests that the method is applicable during the whole path, it doesn’t mean that it will be effective for every little defilement. In fact, without the hypocritical behavior, the method doesn’t make sense. It can, however, be used from time to time, whenever appropriate, whenever a hypocrite is discerned. But I cannot constantly look for the hypocritical behavior, that will drain my mental energy. Instead, I should train myself to be able to discern it when it’s there, in all its different disguises. Discernment first needs to recognize the hypocritical behavior — then, the method can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times when I don’t recognize the hypocritical behavior, yet I can sense that my actions are unskillful, there are still plenty of other methods or tricks I could use. The Buddha had lots of methods he taught, the great forest Ajahns had/have several as well, this method is just one of many. Whatever works — whatever I can do to develop further on the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see now, that the hypocritical behavior that I first conceptualized as the mind was complaining about noise, was really just founded on the existence of heedlessness. If I had was nothing to be heedless about, if I didn’t think it was important to stay on, and develop further on the path, the hypocritical behavior would not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sound-place&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sound is therefore a subset of a place: it can exist in every place.

      &lt;p&gt;There are instances during the practice when there’s no need for an act of will, when the mind will develop by itself. But for those conditions to arise, one cannot be heedless. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:noactofwill&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In-Dream Death Practice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent dream, I found myself on an airplane that had lost control and was on its way down, about to crash. Without pondering whether or not this would eventually lead to my death, the following thought occurred to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, let me die — an as good of a death, that I possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I was inclined to make my death experience as skillful as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This determination was underpinned by my conviction that I already should have had developed a sufficient amount of skills, in preparation, to be able to tackle these kinds of situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a great sense of urgency to the matter since the plane was going down so there was no time to contemplate other themes; I had to go straight to the root causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately put forth the following already self-established and theoretically understood chain of reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the inconstancy of all mental phenomena&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thus, everything dies all the time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thus, there was no self there that could die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though having contemplated inconstancy and not-self like this numerous times before, restating this line of thought helped me disassemble the “I” in “I will die”. As a result, my mind became calmer and more stable. This proved essential because there were a few attempts by the defilements to disturb my determination. They tried to persuade me to pick up the pieces of my dying “I” and reassemble them to be clung to as self again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the conditions were on my side and I managed to ignore them, whereafter the disappeared rather quickly. Had I listened to them though, they would surely have commanded the next herd of related defilements — e.g. anxiety and doubt — to attack and take control, in which case my in-dream death would have been unskillful, terrible and stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, I would say that I was successful, because the dream died before I did (in the dream). As a result of the dream’s sudden death, my previously limited and constrained awareness — having been bound by the dream — became released from its object of clinging (the dream) and began to spread in space around my body.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:unbinding&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:unbinding&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Instantly all blatant stresses from the previous scenario disappeared and the mind attained a much more peaceful state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I had no speculations about whether I actually had died or not — because the dream itself had died instead of me — and I had now become fully aware of the preceding scenario. My eyes was still closed although I was awake (released from the dream).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strengthening-conviction&quot;&gt;Strengthening Conviction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after this event, I analyzed the dream experience — and the process of its abandonment — as analogous to &lt;a href=&quot;/lists/five-aggregates&quot;&gt;The Five Clinging-Aggregates&lt;/a&gt; — in terms of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; abandonment, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dream died instead of me because — from within the dream — I disassembled it, un-fabricated it, un-sustained it; even though the dream was my reference point of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, I compared the dream experience to the experience caused by the clinging-aggregates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Could I, as I advance on the right path of practice — from “within” the clinging-aggregates — disassemble, un-fabricate, un-sustain the clinging to the aggregates; even though the clinging-aggregates are my reference point of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expressed in a different way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the dream died from the lack of sustenance, in the same way, the clinging (to the aggregates) would die from being deprived of sustenance. And just as I awoke from the dream as a consequence of its death; so too, I could allegedly awake from the clinging-aggregates as a consequence of their death — i.e. awake from my experience of dukkha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, was it really sensible to make a comparison like this? Did I gain any value from this line of thought or was it mere intellectual stimulus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gave me additional viewpoints that strengthened my conviction in the clinging-aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessments made in regard to the clinging-aggregates was founded on my already established understanding of them: a sort of understanding that comes from thinking. On the other hand, experiencing the dream dissolving as a result of my actions would count toward the sort of understanding that comes from developing, which is the highest sort of understanding.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sorts-of-understanding&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sorts-of-understanding&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding, gained from the dream arising and passing away, was consistent with the Dhamma; thus my strengthened conviction in the clinging-aggregates and their cessation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:inference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:inference&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, by extension, this means strengthened conviction in dukkha and the end of dukkha. In other words, strengthened conviction in all &lt;a href=&quot;/lists/four-noble-truths&quot;&gt;Four Noble Truths&lt;/a&gt;, the whole of the teachings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflecting-on-regret&quot;&gt;Reflecting on Regret&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the comparison to the five clinging-aggregates there was another noteworthy aspect of the dream: it gave a perspective of experiencing the moments before death.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:dream-quality&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:dream-quality&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the conditions were in my favor in case of this dream, what will be the case when the actual moments before death arrives? Will the conditions be on my side? Will I be able to react to them skillfully? Or — will regret arise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sort of regret? The sort of regret that arise as a result from having (a level of) conviction&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:strengths&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:strengths&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the Dhamma and its goal. It may formulate as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not having taken available opportunities to practice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not having exerted enough effort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not having prepared enough to be able to handle what is now imminent in a better way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sense a strong reaction to regret buried deep in my heart (regret in general). The thought of immense regret arising when my death is imminent has certainly occurred to me. Furthermore, this sort of regret has surfaced on a few occasions when I was under the impression of possibly dying. However, it does not have to be as crucial of a situation as death for this sort of regret to  arise. It might happen after a notification of a deadly illness, or as one finds oneself trapped under a house wreck, or head to head with a tiger, or sinking in quicksand, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of regret, that comes from practicing Dhamma, makes little to no sense in regard to those who are undoubtedly convinced that death is the annihilation of themselves. Why is that? For they are about to be annihilated, what difference does it make if their minds have developed or not? They might have regrets, e.g. of moral nature or because things did not turn out as they had hoped, but for whatever reasons unrelated to the goal of the Dhamma practice. This is the other sort of regret: regret that makes no sense in light of Right View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I am certainly less than one hundred percent convinced that the death of the body brings about the annihilation of self. To me, the risk of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being annihilated cannot be ignored; that is, the risk of the process continuing cannot be ignored. By this reason regret makes sense. Whatever sustains the continuing process must be directed for the sake of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also stated by the Buddha in the texts that the current conditions and the conditions one creates (i.e., what one does) at the time around death are crucial for further becoming. So acting skillfully at the moment of death is very important, which is conceivable based on a good understanding of kamma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream-experience provided additional incentive for me to reflect on regret and what I need to do to prevent this sort of regret from  arising in the future — a relief that there is yet time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:unbinding&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is reasonable that this will happen when a grosser bounding factor is released. In this case, of course, awareness rapidly settled on another more subtle object to cling to and was thus bound again. Please note though, that this is extremely simplified. The mind is clinging to numerous mental objects at any given time frame — binding itself in this manner. Only Nibbāna is complete unbinding according to the Buddha and the Arahants. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:unbinding&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:sorts-of-understanding&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The sort of understanding that comes from developing, from seeing clearly, is the highest sort; it is less biased than understanding that comes from reading or thinking. See &lt;a href=&quot;/lists/three-types-of-understanding&quot;&gt;Three Types of Understanding&lt;/a&gt; for more details. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sorts-of-understanding&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:inference&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let: A: premise of the Dhamma and its goal; B: the dream experience; and C: the Clinging-Aggregates; and further: assume process of B equals C. Then, the sort of understanding gained from the dream experience points to that B conforms to A. Therefore C conforms to A. Uncertainty in the quality of the understanding that B conforms to A, and that B = C; turns the previous conclusion that C conforms to A into: increased conviction in that C conforms to A. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:inference&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:dream-quality&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although It was not a dream in deep sleep: I was probably about to wake up in the next tenths of minutes or so; I could direct my thoughts to a large extent, and decide how to react to things. That said, the clinging to the dream was sufficient enough to fabricate a convincing experience of it being real. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:dream-quality&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:strengths&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Conviction here includes all &lt;a href=&quot;/lists/five-strengths&quot;&gt;Five Strengths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:strengths&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Mindful of Finding Delight</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;As progress is made during practice I will eventually come upon and reveal new and unfamiliar mental territories: conditions where a set of ordinary attachments have diminished, where craving and clinging have weakened. This is expected and in accordance with the path of practice. However, this unfamiliar new realm gives sudden rise to defilements that knock me off my feet. Consequently, I find myself back on familiar grounds and the current progress on the path is interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens when I have completely lost my mindfulness. For a moment, I do not remember — I have no idea — what I am doing, or why I am doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these defilements? I will classify and refer to them as the &lt;em&gt;defilements of unfamiliarity&lt;/em&gt;; attached destructive mental qualities, triggered by the cessation of the ordinary; by going where one has never (or rarely) gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will look into how a sense of delight can help prevent these situations, which in turn, leads to the importance of remembering just that: to be able to make use of delight when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;origination&quot;&gt;Origination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start off by describing the particular occasion from which these writings originate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been re-examining and iterating the sutta &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.020.than.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vitakkasanthana Sutta: The Relaxation of Thoughts&lt;/em&gt;⟶&lt;/a&gt;. The discourse gives four techniques to calm down, weaken and diminish unskillful thoughts: thoughts that lead to suffering, stress, harm, unsatisfactoriness, etc. The ending paragraphs describe a person who has culminated in one or more of these techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He thinks whatever thought he wants to, and doesn’t think whatever thought he doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, having determined to attempt to calm down and weaken a set of my own harmful, unskillful thoughts; an unusual amount of time had passed without these thoughts arising. I was outside of my mental comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this condition that the defilements of unfamiliarity arose and took me back to unprogressive and destructive familiarity again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few seconds later though, I remembered another discourse I had recently read: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.028.than.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ariya-vamsa Sutta: The Discourse on the Traditions of the Noble Ones&lt;/em&gt;⟶&lt;/a&gt;. The following sentence in the description of the fourth tradition came to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the monk finds pleasure and delight in developing (skillful mental qualities), finds pleasure and delight in abandoning (unskillful mental qualities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in my case, since I was “relaxing unskillful thoughts”, it would count as finding pleasure and delight in abandoning unskillful mental qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that the very reason I was thrown off by my defilements in the first place, was a result of having abandoned unskillful qualities — the result of having done what I intended to do. However, I did not do so while “finding pleasure and delight”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defilements that arose as a result of that abandonment (in the absence of mindfulness), were too strong and convincing and led me to think (subtle, implicit) thoughts in terms of: “Why am I doing this?”, “Why don’t I do what I usually do?”, “This is not useful”. And instead of continuing the maintenance of the abandoning I once had started, I interrupt it right there, and “un-abandon” the mental qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as if a person having been blind for that persons whole life — 30 years, 40 years — would suddenly be able to see again, and after a certain time of experiencing vision would get uncertain, confused and disoriented, thinking: “Why am I doing this?”, “Why don’t I do what I usually do?”, “This is not useful”. And so that person withdraws to the comfort of blindness, continues to dwell with eyes closed, not taking the opportunity that is clearly available to develop further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incentive&quot;&gt;Incentive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:: The simple reason that the unfimiliariy got was that there was no samhadhi there as a base. Nevertheless this situation gave me an incentive to looking into the possibilities of delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what sparked my interest when recollecting the forth tradition given in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.028.than.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ariya-vamsa Sutta&lt;/em&gt; ⟶&lt;/a&gt; at that moment — when I realized my defeat — was that if I had been mindful of that I was indeed doing a good task of abandoning as the defilements arose, could I have delighted in that? Would this have lessened the power of these defilements — maybe diminished them completely for the time being? Or enough, anyway, to continue abandoning or maintaining the abandonment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the point comes that I get confused about abandoning and I have lost mindfulness, if I can then remember to delight in that abandoning, it would feel much better, because I know I am doing the right thing, in accordance with my previous intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has happened countless times for me in my practice. And I am quite sure that, the vast majority of the times, I am unaware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s when I  really need to remember to delight in that, because if I forget, I might be taken over by the defilements and the progress will stop. I will close my eyes just like the blind person above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not referring to the delight itself but rather the mindfulness of delighting, i.e. the importance of being able to remember to delight in times of hardship and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I identify four factors at play here, that needs to be investigated. They can be further grouped into enemies and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enemies are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The set of defilements: aka the defilements of unfamiliarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handpicked from the description of the fourth tradition, the good friends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wisdom: When to find delight and appropriately associate it with developing and abandoning as is fitting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mindfulness: remember to find pleasure and delight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each factor here has their own set of strengths and weaknesses. They fight over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before that, lets make some words clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terminology&quot;&gt;Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of the matter in hand, there are a few important keywords and phrases in the fourth tradition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.028.than.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ariya-vamsa Sutta&lt;/em&gt; ⟶&lt;/a&gt; which are in demand of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is appropriate to briefly describe my interpretation and understanding of these; as the comprehension and correctness of concluding thoughts depend on them, I hope to avoid ambiguities and unnecessary misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For recollection here is the excerpt again, it is extremely concise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the monk &lt;strong&gt;finds&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;pleasure&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;delight&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;developing&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;skillful&lt;/strong&gt; mental qualities), &lt;strong&gt;finds pleasure&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;delight&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;abandoning&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;unskillful&lt;/strong&gt; mental qualities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the point here is not to analyze the sutta per se, but rather for the sake of the discussion ahead. Forthcoming use of these words are based on the following elucidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;find--delight&quot;&gt;Find &amp;amp; Delight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When mentioned, these words come coupled together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… finds pleasure and delight…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can not clearly distinguish between the meaning of the words &lt;em&gt;pleasure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;; looking through dictionaries, their definitions are very similar. I am curious to why Than Geoff (translator) uses both words when to me, one of them would suffice.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Unfortunately I unable to derive this from the original source by reason of my limited knowledge in the Pali language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with my understanding of the quote above, and on the inclusion of the word &lt;em&gt;find(ing)&lt;/em&gt;, which points to that delight arises as a cause rather than a result. That is, &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; implies that delight is intentionally generated by exertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this interpretation I will assume the following distinguishing definition between these words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delight is intentionally generated by exertion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pleasure originates as the result of other causes; it has no intentional element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I will henceforth omit the word &lt;em&gt;pleasure&lt;/em&gt; and only use &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt; when referencing this sutta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-and-abandoning&quot;&gt;Developing and Abandoning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… delight in developing (skillful mental qualities)&lt;br /&gt;
… delight in abandoning (unskillful mental qualities)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;em&gt;skillful&lt;/em&gt; mental qualities lead towards the goal, &lt;em&gt;unskillful&lt;/em&gt; ones lead away from the goal. What qualities are skillful is subject to the individual, his/her attainment on the path of practice, his/her wisdom/discernment. What is skillful at one time may be unskillful at another time and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier classified “defilements of unfamiliarity” are clear examples of unskillful mental qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale here is a clear-cut: develop what is skillful, abandon what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to the terms &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; themselves, I interpret them as encompassing the full spectrum from a momentary appliance up towards a continuous appliance&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short-term abandonment is an equally long suppression of the targeted mental qualities; a longer-term abandonment is, accordingly, a suppression for equally long time; a permanent abandonment is the complete destruction of the targeted mental qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies to development as well: a short- and longer-term development is the culmination of whatever skillful qualities lasting for the respective time, after which they fade; a permanent development is the complete cessation of all unskillful mental qualities (fetters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we see as abandoning or developing here is merely a concept; in the end, they actually refer to one and the same thing: progress on the path. One may choose to see something as abandoning, or as developing. It is just how we conceptualize these terms. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-delight&quot;&gt;Right Delight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the two sections above yields &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; delight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delighting in &lt;em&gt;developing skillful&lt;/em&gt; qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delighting in &lt;em&gt;abandoning unskillful&lt;/em&gt; qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; delight would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delighting in &lt;em&gt;developing unskillful&lt;/em&gt; qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delighting in &lt;em&gt;abandoning skillful&lt;/em&gt; qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly important to distinguish. “Wrong” delight is referred to in a number of suttas, for example in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.131.than.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bhaddekaratta Sutta: An Auspicious Day&lt;/em&gt;⟶&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And how does one not place expectations on the future? One does not get carried away with the delight of “In the future I might have such a form”… “feeling”… “perception”… “thought-fabrication”… “consciousness”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In upcoming discussions, whenever &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; are mentioned, they will always connote unskillful mental qualities and skillful mental qualities, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friends&quot;&gt;Friends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having looked at the enemies, the unskillful mental qualities, now I will look into the friends, namely: &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;wisdom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt;. These are the factors that will aid in following through with the depiction in the fourth tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delight&quot;&gt;Delight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the origin section, my hope is that delight will help keep the continuation of the practice by assisting in holding back the defilements. But what is delight really? As established above, it is created by exertion. But what is it essentially? Nothing but a perception. It needs wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wisdom&quot;&gt;Wisdom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom revolves around the content words given in the fourth tradition, namely:
&lt;em&gt;finds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;. Even though the terminology of these words have been lightly covered, they need to be more deeply investigated as it is wisdom’s role and mission to make sure to do the right thing, at the right time, as needed to adhere to the fourth tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;, which implies that it knows &lt;em&gt;defilements&lt;/em&gt; (to some extent).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing whether &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; is in play (dominantly active / operative).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing the benefits of &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt;, i.e generation by exertion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing when and how to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing how to appropriately directing &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt; to either &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing the appropriate time to wait in familiarity before switching to the next unfamiliarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;abandoning-and-developing-spectrum-of-difficulty&quot;&gt;Abandoning and Developing: Spectrum of Difficulty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, abandoning refers to the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities; developing, refers to skillful mental qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue that it is much easier to develop skillful qualities than it is to abandon unskillful qualities. Why is that? It’s the unskillful qualities that has a hold on us, that we are attached to, that we find “dear and appealing”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When abandoning unskillful qualities, we are going against the defilements, performing some kind of renunciation, and there’s a tension there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this true, or are there cases where abandoning is easy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, some unskillful qualities are actually not hard to abandon: those that are clearly causing suffering and are not that dear and appealing. In other words, the areas where wisdom has matured and has surpassed the corresponding defilements. What is “clearly causing suffering” is relative to the persons discernment and position on the path of practice (wisdom, virtue and concentration) — i.e. the strength of wisdom in opposition to the strength of the defilements. Based on this, one can say that there’s both hard and easy abandoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this true for developing as well? Is there hard and easy development? Are skillful mental qualities easy or hard to develop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both. Some are easy; some are hard. Depends on the past and current conditions. For example, for a particular person, a certain level of generosity (as a skillful mental quality) might be very easy to develop, whereas a level of patience or determination could be much harder. So there’s also a spectrum of difficulty in play in this case: in regard to developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about in general terms ? Which one is more difficult: &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;? Or are they both equally difficult?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, we are creating instances of skillful mental qualities. When &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; however, we are destroying instances of unskillful mental qualities. Moreover, we are attached to these mental qualities, we are facing our defilements, doing some kind of renunciation, which creates tension. Hence it is tempting to argue that abandoning would be more difficult since we are breaking attachments, trying to alleviate the tension, whereas developing is the much easier reverse: taking on skillful qualities. But trying to develop can also be hard. So we have no basis on which we can say that abandoning is harder than developing. However there are occasions — and sometimes longer periods — in the training when abandonment is the most apparent factor. In these cases one might mistakenly think abandonment is more difficult since it’s more often surfaced. But again, the same goes for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about in terms of beneficence, would one benefit more from abandoning than developing? Which task is more valuable and rewarding — short and long term? Will one advance faster if abandonment is focused on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. As an overly simplistic example, lets say X number of unskillful qualities are abandoned. That is great. But now lets say the skillful quality of Y was developed instead. In comparison, if Y results in the abandoning of 2 times X, then that &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; of Y was certainly more beneficial than the &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; of X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in terms of these words &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, there is really no inherent reason why one should focus more on abandoning than on developing, or vice versa. There is no advantage of abandoning over developing, they are both equally beneficial. But there surely is a scale of difficulty involved, ranging from easy to hard, in relation to both abandoning and developing, that is a function of the strength of wisdom. Whether it is easy or hard depends on the battle between the defilements and wisdom — between the enemies and the friends. Whoever is stronger wins. If defilements are weak, it will probably be easy for wisdom to win. If defilements are strong, wisdom needs to be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conceptualizing-abandoning-and-developing&quot;&gt;Conceptualizing Abandoning and Developing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that there are two possible routes to act upon the fourth tradition — either delighting in abandonment or delighting in development — how do one choose which route to take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As briefly mentioned earlier, &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; is just a categorization of &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;: when we are abandoning we are developing. The abandonment is development in itself because transitioning from X unskillful qualities to X - 1 is progress, and &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; is also progress. Development is a categorization of abandonment in the same way. Depends on how you say it. You may say: “I am developing the path”; or: “I am abandoning my defilements”. Both terms denote progress towards the supposed goal of the training/teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we do when we say that we are &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; we are creating a concept of these words rather than referring to the actual mental activity that is the literal description in the &lt;em&gt;fourth tradition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept gives us a perception that we can hold on to as a means of simplifying and abstracting either &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; in order to subsequently find delight and associate with the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to correctly — in real time — determine whether the current metal processes conform to the literal description of abandonment or development is much too complex for the state of mind we are in when applying the &lt;em&gt;fourth tradition&lt;/em&gt; (non-appliance will be discussed later). Even if there was such a case that at a given moment there would be only abandonment of unskillful qualities or development of skillful qualities in operation — even so — the next moment can be completely different. So it is really necessary to abstract the intricacies of the mind to a higher level concept; a concept of either abandoning or developing which lasts longer and that we can then use as a target for directing delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, sometimes the developing is apparent; sometimes the abandoning is apparent. This is the more passive/automatic conceptualization that one can notice. As this concept then is already “in the air” one can immediately direct delight there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the more active/intentional case where one decides to look at something as abandonment or development, possibly changing the previous concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s entirely up to oneself to freely choose whether to see something as an abandonment or a development for the sake of directing delight; utilizing the fourth tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exertion-of-delight-spectrum-of-difficulty&quot;&gt;Exertion of Delight: Spectrum of Difficulty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to &lt;em&gt;finding delight&lt;/em&gt; one must have the concept of &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; already available as a target for association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the act of &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, there is a spectrum of gradual difficulty involved when &lt;em&gt;finding delight&lt;/em&gt;. It may be easy sometimes; at other times, much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What determines if it’s easy or hard in this case however is not wisdom’s strength against the strength of the defilements; it is one’s level of right view and comprehension towards the currently targeted concept of &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of having established a concept of that one is &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;, the level of comprehension of the drawbacks of the unskillful mental qualities that are being abandoned determines the level difficulty to &lt;em&gt;find delight&lt;/em&gt;. In regards to the concept of &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, it is the comprehenison of how beneficial the skillful mental qualitites being developed are for future training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, similar to &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, it’s one’s advancements on the path of practice that provide the skill to exert delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;permutations&quot;&gt;Permutations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking through the lens of the forth tradition one can categorize the subjects discussed above into 15 permutations, where each permutation represents a mental extreme point of conditions the mind might be in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;no delight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;hard delight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;easy delight&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neither&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1:1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1:2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1:3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hard abandoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2:1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2:2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2:3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hard developing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3:1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3:2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3:3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy abandoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4:1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4:2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4:3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy developing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5:1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5:2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5:3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wistom’s role here is first and formost to make sure to avoid the first (1:x) row and the first (x:1) column. In other words, we want to make sure to always delight in abandoning/developing to some extent. Preferably we want to use wisdom to come as close to 4:3 and 5:3 as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are brief descriptions of each permutation and what wisdom needs to do to keep on track with the fourth tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[1:x] In the first row in the table above there is no concept of either abandonment or development apparent. The non-existance of abandoning does not imply automatic existance of developing. A concept of either abandoning or developing needs to be established here. If this is not done, there is no target for directing delight; this is the precondition for &lt;em&gt;finding delight&lt;/em&gt;.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;[1:1] Establish concept of abandoning or developing first.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;[1:2] Establish concept of abandoning or developing first.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;[1:3] Understand that the delight needs to be directed to abandoning or developing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[2:x] Hard to abandon.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[3:x] Hard to develop.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The defilements are not strong [4th row] so abandoning is easy. There is not much tension.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Even though it is easy to abandon, does not mean that there is automatically delight. You need to exert delight to adhere to the forth tradition.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If it is hard to exert delight we must find a way. For example we could switch the concept of abandoning to developing (-&amp;gt; 5:2), given this perception it might be easier. More on this in later section.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Good place to be. Stay here to get familiar with the current absent of defilements. Be alert to new defilments arising. Or, if current situation is stable, wisely decide how long to get familiarized until moving on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When developing is easy [5th row] developing skillful qualities is effortless. Similar to when learning a new skill, like cooking, without any effort.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;See 4:1&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;See 4:3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summarize&quot;&gt;Summarize&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What differs between &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; in these permutations (moving vertically across rows), is the current concept of abandoning and developing. When there’s no concept of abandoning or developing, even though actual abandonment or developing may be taking place, there is no abandonment/developing in terms of fourth tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What determines &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;abandonment&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; is the strength of the defilements as opposed to wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What determines &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt; (moving horizontally across columns)? Is what determines hard/easy abandonment/development and hard/easy delight the same thing or different things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, its all wisdom. But different appliance of wisdom. Wisdom’s strength against the defilements determines whether it is hard/easy to abandon/develop (abandonment/development in turn depends on the concept). Wisdom’s ability to exert delight in the presence of the current mental conditions determines whether it is hard/easy to delight (delight itself depends on the perception).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct the delight to what is fitting. If abandonment makes more sense and is most helpful in the current case, direct the delight there, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen, wisdom plays an important role in that it pulls the content words (&lt;em&gt;finds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt;) given in the &lt;em&gt;fourth tradition&lt;/em&gt; together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One possibility, although I may be grasping at straws here, is that the sutta refers to mental fabrications (sankharas), which are feelings and perceptions. Furthermore, pleasure is a feeling; delight is a perception. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More or less automatic at that stage of practice. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Relatively Right</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;A citizen of The Great City in the north-west is outside of the city borders on errands one day. Passing over the south-eastern border he sees a wandering traveler. As the traveler is not heading in the direction of The Great City — as is the norm — the intensions of this peculiar traveler sparks the citizen’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching the traveler, he initiates a conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Excuse me fellow traveler. I am a citizen of The Great City north-west from here. I once traveled here many years ago from the south. I assume you came from southern parts too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And may I ask where you are headed? You are clearly not headed towards The Great City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am not. For the moment I am traveling north-east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can see that. But what is your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It may be referred to as the further destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have never heard of such place. What will you do when you reach it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will call it my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So is it far from here? When do you expect to arrive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is probably very distant, yes. My arrival is not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen is unconvinced as to why such far travels are necessary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why are you aiming to reach such faraway location? All peoples wishes lies somewhere within the borders of The Great City. All travels end there. Mine did too. They have for centuries. This is the first time I have seen a traveler that is not headed towards it. Is not what you are searching for within the borders of The Great City?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And your destination? How do you know that it serves your wishes? Have you been there before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Its promise fulfills what I am searching for. I have never been there, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who promises? Where have you heard of this place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have heard of people that supposably live there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have you met any of these people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No. Although I have met a few other travelers — with the same destination — who in turn have met people who were said to live there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So this is all the information you have? Can you trust these travelers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even though I greatly respect and have conviction in some of these travelers, I cannot completely trust them, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems very unwise and risky to take on such travels based on this sparse and uncertain information. Did they give you directions at least?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, these directions have been passed down from traveler to traveler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen suspects this is a bad idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So now you are following directions which you do not know if they are valid because they were given by people you cannot trust. In addition, the source of the directions are unknown. How do you know if your supposed destination — your future home as you say — even exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I do not know. With regard to this uncertainty involved with the given directions and the destination itself, I am honestly aware of that the destination is indeed a hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen is perplexed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So let me see if I understand you correctly: not only do you not know if your destination exists — you are still willing to possibly spend your whole life reaching it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time the citizen does not rule out the possibility that the traveler might be a full-fledged fool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How can you go on with such uncertainty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler notices the citizen’s concern and resolves to explain his strategy thoroughly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Directions do not have to be either correct nor incorrect. Parts of them can be correct while other parts can be incorrect. There can also be correct parts but the person following them do not understand or misinterprets them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, I would agree to not rule out the possibility of the directions being correct; nevertheless, I am yet wondering how one can proceed in a wise manner on such loose grounds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good directions also describe objects as they occur along the way. For example: “head straight until you see a barn, there you should turn left at the crossing”. Upon reaching this specific point you can determine — to some extent — that that part of the directions were correct, which in turn strengthens the conviction that the directions at least have some validity to them. Of course this could be any barn at any crossing. But after iterating this type of verification process, the conviction of the validity of the directions as a whole — or at large — increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is also another aspect to it. Some of the destination’s promising factors — as they have been described to me — are said to be gradually crystallizing the closer to the destination you reach. It is a similar experience to when you are far north and travel south, it gradually gets warmer. You would know you are traveling south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler concludes his explanation by emphasizing the importance of meticulousness and self honesty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keeping in mind though — there will never be any unexplored distinct direction further ahead that can be taken as correct in advance. Starting off you intentionally establish each direction as assumed correct — or possibly unlikely correct — using your current skill set. In the case of following through — only then — are there grounds for reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen is still reluctant to accept the traveler’s intentions as something worth the effort as opposed to entering The Great City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So you can use a pragmatic approach. But fact remains — without any concrete evidence of the destination — time is your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler concurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes friend, you are indeed correct. Aging is always present and my death may come at any time. I must not lose focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen becomes concerned and compassionate for the traveler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me remind you, dear fellow traveler, that you can apply for residency in The Great City right now without much further effort on your part. I have good news. I am in fact a member of the city council. I can take you there immediately and we can arrange for your stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I thank you for your offer but as I said, I have no interest in living there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What if you die without having reached your destination? When near the hour of your death, what would you do? A wasted life for sure. I fear you will regret yourself deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What do you suppose my regrets would be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Missing out on the opportunities, happiness and love in The Great City. Its citizens form a loving and generous community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I see. Well there was a time when I was indeed aspiring to settle within the borders of The Great City. Since then my views have changed as a result of being unsatisfied with inherent qualities in The Great City itself.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These qualities constitutes a subset of the causes for my changed views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler continues his reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So why would I regret missing out on The Great City and its wonders — when those themselves — were part of the causes that led me to search for a further destination to begin with? It is against logic, against reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You would realize that the stubbornness and pride of holding on to your changed views cost you your good life in The Great City. You would desperately wish for another chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s say that when lying in my deathbed — near the last hour of my life — I am given the gift of youth and taken back to this exact location where we now stand. Having experienced the failure of my earlier travels, it would be another chance to enter The Great City and prosper in life there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But you would not enter, would you? I have seen mules less stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would not. The Great City is simply not to my satisfaction.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So on the contrary: I would argue that I would regret myself deeply near the hour of my death, if I had not taken upon myself to honestly search for my current destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And in the case you were shown — in an undeniable way — that your destination did not even exist? You would be a fool to continue on your travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, in such case I should interrupt my search, realize that the assumption of my destination was false, and discard the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I find this very likely to happen. In this case you would definitely have wasted your life wandering in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I disagree. For me, it is not only the destination of my travel that is right, but also the traveling itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen disapproves of the travelers selfishness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You say. Seems like you are just thinking of yourself and your traveling. Do you just wander along with no regard for others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If that were the case, how could I consider the traveling itself to be right? Furthermore, there are times that I temporarily interrupt my traveling for the benefit of others. Is not that what I am doing right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, I suppose I have been asking a lot of questions. It is getting late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;May I conclude our friendly discussion because it is indeed darkening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen nods. The traveler concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me ask you — we both came here from the south — would you go back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--
&gt; Let me ask you. 

&gt; We both came here from the south. Would you go back?

&gt; Let me ask you, as we both came from the south. Would you ever want to go back?

&gt; Let me ask you — we both came here from the south — would we consider returning?
--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would not. I travelled here because I came to an understanding that it is not an appropriate way of life in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And neither would I. All people in the north share this common view. We all traveled northward because we individually developed the understanding that life in the north is more valuable, more right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, the northern areas was the right destination for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler brings up the multitude in the north:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the north is not small. There are several smaller cities south of The Great City where travelers have settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, some settle in the suburbs, they do not continue to The Great City, that is their right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--
&gt; Well some settle in the suburbs, at least for a while, that is their right.

&gt; Well yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. These travelers decided to not continue to The Great City, that’s their right.

&gt; Well yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. Some travelers decided to settle there, it is their right.

&gt; Yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. These travelers decided to settle there by their own right.  

&gt; Yes, the suburbs are heavily populated. Travelers settle there, at least for a while. It is what they feel is right for them. But the tendency for most is to migrate further and further towards The Great City.

&gt; Yes, some stay there, at least for a while. It is what they feel is right for them. But the tendency is to migrate further and further towards The Great City.
--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, but even within The Great City there are differences in cases of what is considered right; there is a strive for what is individually right; there are individual forces of right. As a member of the city council, do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, the preferences of citizens in our city may differ. Some citizens prefer to live in the center part, some rather stay in calmer neighborhoods, and their choice of livelihood varies in a large range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler reminds the citizen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But even so — in the presence of these differences — there is still the common fundamental understanding of “right” among all citizens of the north. It forms the basis for living together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--
&gt; But even so, the common fundamental understanding of right among all people that have travelled to the north is what form the basis for living together. 
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen chimes in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Especially in The Great City. It is what makes The Great City great. Our common understanding indeed provides the basis for our individual differences to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveler continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And one could further argue that the individual differences is a support for the community. If everyone had the same preferences of “right” there would be communal areas of lacking functionality. As a member of the city council, do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Agreed. Our differences in what we see as “right” is effectively contributing to the city and gives it its variety. But as you say, as long as we adhere to our common understanding of “right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To conclude our discussion. I will continue traveling to my destination. And on success, I will pass on my revised directions where they are asked for. I will have done the right thing for myself and contributed by assisting others doing their rights in case they align with mine. In case of failure, I will recognize that. It is nevertheless a contribution. It is homogenous with the process within your city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--
Just like in the city, right?

Yes, in this way the city develops along the lines with what communally consider is right.

And for each individual, such as myself, it is how I develop along the lines with what I consider is right.
--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is how the city develops along the lines of what we consider is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And it is how I develop in line with what I consider is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Goodbye traveler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen lights his lantern and walks back towards the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reasons to why this is unsatisfactory is intentionally not mentioned by the traveler. The irrelevancy of the unsatisfactoriness, yet the presence of it’s result, is effectively the point of the discussion. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
